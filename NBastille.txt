Protection The crux is protected by a bolt at your feet, but there are other considerable moves with trad gear or little gear at all protecting the fall. A rack with a single set of muts and cams 0.5"-3" is probably as good as you can do. [The] larger cams fit in a horizontal placement before the crux bolt and do add mental comfort/security to the long moves to reach the clip.

        I love the story of the first free ascent.  Ray Northcutt, who must have been strong as an ox since he could do 100 pullups, was incorrectly told that Layton Kor had freed the direct start to the Bastille Crack.  Upon learning this, Northcutt went out the next day and fired the line, only later learning that his was indeed the FFA.    I think this is generally acknowledged to be a bona fide 5.11- pitch nowadays, and when you consider that it was nearly a decade later that Ament, et al. were being credited with climbing the "first" 5.11 routes in the U.S., it serves to emphasize Northcutt's achievement on this short route, as well as the powerful impact one's mindset can have on climbing performance.    Free your mind...




        By  Kreighton BiegerJul 20, 2001


        Well, if you're wondering what Eldo 11- feels like, try this. I didn't get the route, but I can say, in case you're wondering, that the old ring pin (circa 1959??) will hold. At least, as of this morning it held two pretty good whippers from around the corner (and three smaller ones too!). Yes, I made it past the crux and around onto the 'good' slopers and came off. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful route and it is a shame the first part of it doesn't go on for another 100'.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        I find 10d to be a suitable grade, considering the first 30 feet are no harder than 8+, and the crux is so short.  Even if the ring pin did pull/break, the pin below it is great and the gear options below that even better (.75 Camalot).  Also, I find this pitched linked with P2 of the Bastille into Outer Space to be a good warm up to the X-M/Outer Space link-up:  the difficulties are similar, only difference is the quality of gear.




        By  Brian SordenAug 24, 2001


        Adendum to the historical note.  This was the first 5.10 in Colorado, and very possibly the first in America.  Not only was Northcutt sandbagged into doing it in 1959, there wasn't another 5.10 done in Colorado until well into the sixties.  I do support the 10d rating.  The "trick" is a tiny foot cup stemming right onto the arete, two inches below a small upside down triangular lip.




        By  Hayden YurkanisNov 6, 2001


        Great climb!!! Wouldn't consider it to be harder than 10+




        By  Lon BlackApr 29, 2003


        What a sweet pitch.  Ray Northcutt did a hell of a job.  Well Kreighton, that pin on the traverse still holds a fall.  I took one on it today because I'm a dumbass.  It's amazing how much harder a move can be when you don't use your head and eyes to find footholds.




        By  Bo JohnstonJun 2, 2006 rating:  5.10d 6b+ 21 VII+ 21 E3 5b$(function(){$('#stars_2050468096').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I toproped this 2 days ago and pulled it right away.  I'm not convinced that I could pull it off as quickly on lead but I'm gonna try!  I didn't have any beta on the route and can't see why people find the move so mysterious.  It was simply hard on my fingertips.  Ouch!




        By  Kurt JohnsonFrom: Estes Park, CONov 2, 2006


        In his mid 70s, Ray still is as strong as an ox. When he shakes your hand he just about breaks it!

        The pin at the crux traverse was still good when I fell on it last week...




        By  tooTALLtimFrom: Boulder, COAug 7, 2007$(function(){$('#stars_476874453').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Amazing climb!  Great crack climbing with an exciting finish.  If you can't lead it (like me), TR it from Bastille's anchors, very fun.




        By  Bruce HildenbrandJan 31, 2008


        You can do a variation at the top of the climb.  Rather than traverse right at the pin, continue up the ever thinning crack to the anchor.  Not much protection for the leader.  On a TR it felt about 5.11b.




        By  tooTALLtimFrom: Boulder, COApr 7, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_151220573').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        The pin is still good :-p




        By  DarrJun 10, 2008


        I had a question on the route.  Can I safely get to the anchors to setup my own top rope?  I'm going to be climbing solo and while I have all the logistics setup so I can do that safely (backups to all of my protection), I need to be able to get up to the top anchors for this route without any protection.  Can it be done without having to go really far out of my way to get up the rock?  Thanks for any help.




        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COJun 10, 2008


        Easiest way to get to the anchors is pitch 1 of Bastille Crack.  So unless you can free solo 5.7, you can't get to the anchors without protection.




        By  GeoffElson ElsonJun 27, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_1733924904').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        The pin is still good, but doesn't really come into play if you put one of your smallest cams in the pocket a few inches to the left, the pocket isn't really essential for the move. I placed a tiny gray TCU, and it fit easily with space on either side.




        By  RiggerMortisFrom: Albuquerque New MexicoJul 11, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_1614369553').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I'd say it's all 5.7 to 5.8 except for the crux move.  BTW, it CAN be done without the mystery foothold.  You just have to place your left foot really high and hang from the sidepull in the dihedral with your left hand while reaching around the corner for a pinky and ring finger lock in the crack.  Then grunt and send.  This worked for me (but my partner swore it wouldn't 'til I did it:)  Might not work if you're short.  I'm 5'10"




        By  Top Rope HeroFrom: Was Estes Park, now homelessApr 29, 2010 rating:  5.11- 6c 22 VIII+ 22 E3 5c$(function(){$('#stars_995434496').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Feels like 5.11 death if'n you've got fat fingers and can only wrench at most your tips at the crux finger lock.  Oh--and decades later, that pin/ring is still holding leader falls....




        By  TBDMay 26, 2010$(function(){$('#stars_792043249').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        The grade isn't really that important to me, but for context this feels harder than the first pitch of Genesis and at least as difficult as the crux on the Northwest Corner.  Fun little route.




        By  Phil LauffenFrom: The BubbleSep 12, 2010 rating:  5.10d 6b+ 21 VII+ 21 E3 5b$(function(){$('#stars_979413701').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Harder to onsight.... Once you fall on the pin once, you get the general idea, and it's relatively easy.




        By  Marty CombsFrom: Boulder, COApr 7, 2011 rating:  5.11a 6c 22 VII+ 22 E3 5c$(function(){$('#stars_1749420538').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        A superb climb, but it is a little spicy cranking the crux above the 2 old, rusty pitons.  Old pitons are always good until they're not.




        By  NickViatorFrom: Denver, COAug 25, 2013


        Luckily I didn't have to test the ring piton on this climb yesterday, but the party below me took a fall on it and it held.  From what I've read, that piton must have held thousands of falls over the years.  Great short climb nonetheless.




        By  bonnie bonbitsFrom: colorado front rangeJun 6, 2014


        Delicate, thin bits at the crux, yes, but with the piton and good pro just before and after it, it totally goes. Full-on technical bits, definitely not strengthy. So being 5'3" at best, and in Eldo, I'm quite rather surprised by the 5.10"d" rating. Especially since the entire bit to the crux is smooth jammin' and restful climbing (because I'm definitely not an Eldo 5.10 leader, and I've backed off Eldo 5.9s harder than this).




        By  Peter LewisFrom: Bridgton, MaineSep 16, 2014


        I remember falling on that pin in 1983. Nice to know it's still good.

        So good. Stellar movement. Wish this was a full pitch!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Start on Bastille Crack, but at the top of the initial flake go straight up instead of moving left into BC.  There is a bolt beneath an overlap (crux), then up past a second bolt.  The route then goes right into 'Wide Country'.   Originally a long pitch that paralleled BC with a 5.12 move up high, this was an unfortunate casualty of the 1988 bolt wars that had the belay and protection bolt high on pitch removed.  Location Start as with Bastille Crack.Protection Bolts and thin gear.   Hardly a sewup.

        Rob set the bolts for this with Matt on TR.  When he led it with me belaying, the bolt studs were in, but he carried a bag of hangers and a wrench. So, as he got to each bolt, he slapped on a bit of glue, installed the hanger, then clipped the bolt.  Pretty fun methodology.  There was also a two-bolt belay (at a shelf close to the end of P2 of BC) that made this a great, long pitch.  At the height of the bolt wars, this belay and protection bolt for the upper section were excised.  The climb now  joins 'Wide Country' instead of continuing up.

        Great Route!  Rob told me to get on this route and Interceptors 11c, 2 routes that I think he has FAs of, so I hopped on both.  This route is way harder than Interceptors, maybe even 12a  I had a tough time figuring out which way to go (L, R, up) in the middle of the route about 15 feet before the mini-roof.  In the process, I broke off the biggest foothold I could find making it quite thin there.  Check it out.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Found and inspired by Chip Ruckgaber, Space is one of those routes that is very obvious once you look at it but it has been passed up by climbers for years.  It is the obvious, right-angling strata that begins about 20' up the third pitch of Wide Country and traverses all the way across the upper North Face until you can finish up Saturnalia.  Look on page 51 of the Levin guide and you'll see it.Location Approach via Wide Country or the Bastille Crack.  Set a gear belay at an old piton at the base of Wide Country's third pitch.  Head up Wide Country for about 20' (10c) to the beginning of the angling strata that shoots all the way across the upper North face.  Place gear high on Wide Country and head out onto the face toward a bolt on Hairstyles.  Continue the pumpy, rising traverse toward Outer Space (medium nut & 1.5" cam).  Cross Outer Space and continue toward Saturnalia.  Place a good 3" cam then head up Saturnalia.  Pumpy.  The crux is probably the section that crosses Hairstyles.Protection Standard Eldo rack.  Lots of long slings.  Consider bringing extra 0.5-2.5" cams if you place a lot of gear on the first 20' of Wide Country's  third pitch.  #4 cam could be useful, but not necessary.  Clip a bolt on Hairstyles as you cross that route.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Outer Face may not be worth doing on its own, but it really is the natural finish pitch to the classic Northwest Corner.  The business of the Northwest Corner finishes up on the big Outer Space ledge.  Instead of heading around the corner here, continue straight up on humungous jugs and slightly rotten rock - this is very steep and a lot of fun.  Above here you continue up a crack to a ledge below a slab.  Place gear at your feet and then head up the slab to an obvious undercling and gear placement (Yellow Alien).  Falling on this slab would land you on the ledge ten feet below, but it's only 8+/9- and fairly secure.  A difficult move up past the undercling brings you to a stance where you can get some decent gear.  Head straight up and over the (hard 5.10 move on lichen, gear below your feet), or traverse right (5.9 good gear) and up to the top of the belay.Protection Aliens are helpful.  There are some short runouts above ledges.

        ...The step-across onto the undercling flake can be protected by a 3.5 friend placed to the right in a funky heuco. The placement is hard to see at first but it's actually pretty good.




        By  TBDJun 16, 2003


        When I climbed this, it was as a finish to the Northwest Corner.  My partner had led the last pitch of the Northwest Corner and continued past the Outer Space ledge up to the ledge below the slab, and set a belay there.  It made a lot of sense to do it that way.  While the slab section is short, it was nice to be belayed when my belayer could see me, as it does get a little thin and a fall could result in hitting the ledge below the slab.

        This is a great pitch. Not quite as exposed as Outer Space, less awkward and no pigeon shit. Worth doing again. The first half of the pitch is only 5.8 but fun with decent gear to be found amongst the choss. Rock gets very solid for the exit of the first overhanging bit with more decent gear just above. The most dangerous part is stepping over to place a piece in the undercling, a 5.9 friction move. Brad's beta for the big cam is spot on with the placement at waist level a few feet to the side. The crux is on amazing Bastille rock with good pro through it and after. Tried the left finish which has a couple of holds leading into it and then nothing but lichen. I ended up going right around the final overhang, better pro and easier.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is the route between the first pitch of Werk Supp and the beginning of the fourth pitch of the Bastille Crack.  It makes for an excellent day and avoids the line at the bottom of the Bastille Crack.  To get to the route: climb the first pitch of Werk Supp to the bolts 5.8+.  From the bolts, head west up the ramp with an emphasis on the outside of the ramp.  Continue up through a squeeze/overhanging section where a piton marks the crux 5.8.  Once through the crux, cross the ramp and set up shop for the fourth pitch of the Bastille Crack.  Link the last two pitches of the Bastille for a great day.Protection Bring a normal rack; mostly mid-sized pieces.  There is an OK looking piton at the crux.

        There is also a ramp system to up or down-climb between the top of P1 of WerkSupp & top of P2 of Bastille Crack.  This is distinct from the above described line.  The down-climb is useful if you want to bail (rain, hail, whatever) & don't want to leave gear & don't trust a single old pin.  It's much easier than 5.8.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 20, 2005


        Sorry, I meant "third pitch variation."  As a young teen, the third pitch intimidated me for a few years, so I would sneak around the corner to the left and climb the awkward dihedral/slot with the fixed pin.

        I could be wrong, but I do not remember seeing a piton when I climbed this.  Nevertheless, it protected well.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Cross-country connects the blissfully blank Crossfire with the esoteric Wide Country.  Climb Crossfire to just past the first bolt, then angle up and right to the Wide Country corner immediately below the crux, and continue with that route to the belay.  Now choose any of several pitches above, or better (at least for Alex and myself), rappel and go drink beer.  Best done in hot, humid conditions when at least two chronic tendonitis-type injuries have resurfaced for each climber involved.  Protection Rack per standard Eldorado Canyon requirements.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Bold but not death defying for those comfortable with soloing 10a.  A coup in your belt for doing this one.  This route is included in Steve Levin's "Spice Tour" description, but because of its quality, deserves its very own entry.  Get to this climb by either climbing the first pitch of Wide Country, the first two pitches of XM, or the first pitch and 1/2 of the NW Corner.  If starting from XM, traverse right until you are on top of the NW Corner finger crack.  Clip a bolt off the belay ledge, but otherwise not much pro until you arrive here.    Head up and left to an undercling flake which you should lace with gear because that is going to be it for awhile.  Now up and slightly right on great edges but zero pro (10a) brings you to a short but welcome crack.  Watch out for the loose hold somewhere before you reach this crack.  Pulling this off would result in a nasty fall.  Stuff the crack with lots of cams of around 1" size.  The crux is a bit run-out too, but after the face climbing you just did, it feels pretty close.  A short, much easier & well protected dihedral lands you on the big ledge below the Outer Space headwall.  David A. TurnerProtection Standard Eldo rack (be sure to include one inch cams).

        I thought this was sufficiently terrifying - I was more scared than on Jules Verne at least.  The loose hold on the run out is a serious disaster waiting to happen.  The hardest move of the run out (the actual crux comes later and is well protected) comes right before this hold - both my partner and I latched onto it and moved up to a better stance on it, only feeling it flexing after the fact.  Someone please go up there and knock the thing off - preferably while seconding.  Also, Rossiter's topo is misleading on this climb for three reasons. First, if you start this from the anchors atop Wide Country, you traverse almost straight right past a bolt, not up into the 5.9 variation of XM as shown. Second, there isn't an 11a S move near the top of the NW Corner piton crack as shown. Third, the run out is definitely more serious than 9+ S as shown.  The climbing is pretty darn good though!  A long, sustained, and interesting pitch.

        While the runout is pretty serious, it is definitely more mental than really difficult.  I wouldn't say it was any harder than 10a.  Concerning the loose hold, it would be great if it was gone but I didn't feel like it was necessary to even go near it to finish the runout.  With that said... WOW, Holy Shit!  What an amazing pitch!

        I followed this climb with my friend Joe yesterday.  We were doing the "spice tour".  What an incredible pitch!  I agree with the other comments that it is BOLD, but not death defying.  Yes, there are some huge runouts, but on moderate rock.  Leaving the belay and traversing over to the pin on NW corner is probably the spookiest section.  Besides the bolt at the start, there is no pro for quite a ways.  The runout below the crux would be very spicy on the sharp end, and yes, the loose hold is still there.  It kinda caught me off guard.  The crux section has bombproof gear about at your feet and  it's really only a couple hard moves of 11.  I guess I'll be on the sharp end next time.  This climb should definitely be on every hardman/woman's ticklist.  4 STARS!!

        Back on this one again today with Joe.  I was on the sharp end this time.  I found myself with another case of "pastemouth" similar to last weekend on JV.  Good thing you're pulling the crux with great gear near by.  This climb is delicate and balancy is spots way out on marginal pro.  Classic hairshow!  Oh, I think the loose hold is gone.




        By  JelloJun 17, 2007


        On the first ascent of this pitch, I actually started from the second belay on XM, but instead of going straight right past a bolt, I followed the little arching corner up and right (part of the 5.9 XM variant Josh mentions above) and from its' end continued up and right across blank rock to meet the flake below the runout slab at its' bottom.  This makes a more independent and committing route than the one described, but overall about the same technical difficulty.  Rossiter's guide is correct.  Glad you guys are enjoying the climb.  -Jello

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is a fun pitch that I had never seen anyone doing. This is the prominent crack line that diagonals up across the pillar between the first pitches of X-M and Northwest Corner. There appear to be two ways to get to the start of the traverse. The guide describes climbing the major left-facing corner that leads to the X-M chimney. I have no idea how hard this is, or if it's any good. There was chalk on the way we went, which was to do a cool boulder problem through an overhang, about 10 to 12 feet right of the start of X-M, to reach a stance and protection point. Then move right six feet or so to a series of corners and overlaps that are followed up and left to the wad of slings at the base of the X-M chimney (a bit of loose rock, but otherwise fun). Clip the wad (long sling), and follow the traverse line to join Northwest Corner. Save a purple Camalot or equivalent for the traverse (wires can be placed, too, but it's strenuous). It's maybe 5.9 or so to the start of the traverse, and 10c seems right for the typical Eldo scrabbly moves across the pillar. Good stuff.  Rap or lower from the Northwest Corner anchor, or carry on up Northwest Corner or X-M.Protection Standard Eldo rack, with extra long runners and/or double ropes.

        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COJun 25, 2003 rating:  5.10c 6b 20 VII 20 E2 5b R$(function(){$('#stars_1130758788').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Dougald, I saw you on it last weekend and Commented to my partner "Somebody's on Independent Study. I've never seen anyone else on that before." I did it more or less straight up in 1996 with Mark Spieker, Done this way you just get bad stoppers in bad flakes, and only here and there. It's reminiscent of Marie Antoinette, but harder with some bad holds. I thought it was a scary 5.10c, maybe a few moves that were harder, for the sake of skipping suspect holds.




        By  Matt BattagliaAug 5, 2007


        So a few weeks ago someone told me that this was a great alternative first pitch to NW corner and that it had great gear ("good small wires"), so I got on it and got spooked.  What I found: There is a good purple Camalot right at the crux (didn't have it that day) but it's tough to place and it takes up a key hand hold making the crux harder (I felt) than most 10c's. A decent, purple TCU can be placed from the good stance before the crux and then that frees up the good hold.  Placing the "good small wires" the rest of the way is hard, best to just punch it.  Cool movement. There's a fixed wire/HB brassy on the route after the crux.




        By  Lisa MontgomeryFrom: Golden, COMay 6, 2016


        This is a worthwhile route for the obscure tour. I'd recommend bringing plenty of RPs and small nuts. I placed a #4 Camalot at the nest of slings in the bottom of the OW before starting the traverse. A baggy 0.5 or tight 0.75 fits okay at the crux. I was able to get a good green Alien right after that.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This "everyman's" variation avoids the run out start and the 5.11 crux of Wide Country 105760527which is the first pitch of The Direct North Face and allows one to climb the rest of the DNF at only 5.10. The middle pitch of X-M is now the spice crux with this variation.  Climb the Bastille Crack past the chain anchor of the first pitch. At the top of the chimney flare, traverse right, obvious 5.7, into the final 5.10c section of the first pitch of Wide Country. Double runners on any pro above the chains on BC before moving right are helpful to avoid rope drag.  See Steve Levin's description of the DNF for the full route beta.Protection Standard Eldo rack.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Ever wondered to what route those 4 old pins belonged as you rappelled off the first pitch of Werk Supp?  Well here it is.  Find this obscure short pitch just above the first pitch of March of Dimes or starting perhaps 15 feet L of the upper 70 feet of Werk Supp's first pitch on the North Face of the Bastille.  Described by Rossiter's guide as "this pitch parallels the upper half of P1 of Werk Supp on the left."  This route probably warrants the bomb rating for the rock bomb potential at least along the line we took.  From the little saddle behind the March of Dimes buttress, move slightly R and find a bugaboo (or KB?) a few feet off the ground.  You can try to find ways past the pin to the R to avoid touching this huge, tilted, detached flake (now removed) precariously perched up and L of this pin, but neither of us felt it was less than 5.10.  Certainly, moving up and R seemed likely to enter X or VS range (if this is the actual line, you should ignore this next bit about the flake and the rating).  Then again, so did up and L.    Our efforts required a gentle lieback on this flake (now removed) and fearful stepping upon it to traverse L.  The upper part of this flake shifted an inch with gentle outward pressure inward or outward.  Arrggghhhh!  Reminiscent of Cannon Mountain (NH) rock, this huge block could take out the belay or belayer below and would definitely take out a car on the road.  Don't think you're safe yet.  As you gain this up and R ramp, you must face other stacked blocks that make you try to minimize your presence.    Finally, reach a decent angle pin (partially hidden under a lump of grass in the crack) in solid rock.  From here the route is more technically but less psychologically difficult.  Continue up to a KB.  Here you go up and highstep L into a briefly fractured band.  Climb past what-appears-to-be a soft iron pin and reach the belay thankful for metastabilities.  On the positive side, at least none of the 4 pins shift with hand pressure.    Perhaps somethings are better not climbed.Protection 4 pins (in situ), hmmm, not much else.

        I never knew this route existed before Leo's post, so I had to go right out and get it! I have to agree on the bomb, but it's too bad we couldn't tag on a couple of negative stars. This would be minus-**.




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COJun 25, 2004 rating:  5.10a 6a 18 VI+ 18 E1 5a$(function(){$('#stars_118994508').html(starsHtml(2, 'avg'));});


        Well...Seeing people rate a route this badly, I just had to go try it.  On TR though, given the death flake warnings.  First off, I only found 3 of the pins. Second of all it seemed S but not VS.  The 50 pound block loose on top of the death flake was removed with benevolence it now lies 6 meters right of the base of Werks Supp.  The remaining flake will easily hold a climber, but I wouldn't take a big fall on a cam behind it...  The rest of the route was OK. Tricky to lead? Yes.  Sandbagged? Yes.  Minus two stars?  Not that bad. There are numerous hidden holds that bring this into reality.  It's on the shy side of a star, but the route is not a total bomb.

        Tried this route today and I have to agree on the Bomb rating, mainly because of the lack of pro and the large detached flake.  Also it may very well be closer to an 'x', at least the way we did it.  On lead I got forced left from the top of the flake (5.9)  because of the lack of pro, in my opinion, the flake will come off if you fall on the nuts or cams you place behind it.  Above that there is no pro till you get to the third pin if you go right from the top of the flake (.10). If you go straight up from the top of the flake it's probably 9+ but again there is very little in the way of good pro till you get to the third pin.  Never did see the angle piton but it is probably hidden in the grass off to the left someplace.

        About 3 years ago, (on June 25th, 2004 to be more precise) the loose part of the death flake was briefly in the middle of the road.  Now, it's more off on the side.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description P1: Wide Country. Begin right of the Bastille Crack, at a shallow left-facing corner system.  Climb this (5.9) with thin but adequate gear, being mindful of a large semi-detached block 50 feet up.  Above this, at a bolt, climb up and left (crux, 5.11a if you have it wired), then back right to an obvious overlap (hand-sized cam) which you turn on the right, then up to the chain anchors at a nice stance (a 60m rope just makes it to the ground).    P2: XM to Outer Space.  From the belay stance, head up and slightly left, past a couple of fixed pins, to a short, steep wall where the seam fades (small RP here).  This is the traditional third pitch of XM.  Pull this move (5.10b R), and head up forty feet into the Outer Space dihedral (5.10a) and the large ledge below the headwall, and belay.  P3: Outer Space.  Now undercling up and left to the prominent crack system splitting the upper headwall (this is the last pitch of Outer Space).  Follow the crack as it zig-zags up, finally reaching the top at some solution pockets.Protection Standard Eldo bag-o-trix.

        I looked around for the initials on Outer Space today(4/18), but couldn't find them. I stopped and looked at every conceivable sloping stance where a hanging belay would be possible. Any hints, how big are they.




        By  Michael KomarnitskyFounding FatherFrom: Seattle, WAJan 1, 2001


        I love how some people, when adding routes, describe the pro.  Its not scary or poor protection - it's "exciting", or "a little spicy."  :-)




        By  Patrick VernonFrom: Estes Park, COJan 1, 2001 rating:  5.11- 6c 22 VIII+ 22 E3 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_1873188793').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        The first pitch of this feels quite hard for .11a, very cool footwork intensive crux.




        By  Anonymous CowardAug 1, 2001


        For those who want to be more precise about their spice, the 10b crux on the second pitch is protected by the smallest rp I own.  Even with a screamer, I doubted it would hold.  The next piece down, a pin, is maybe 8-10 feet below your feet when you make the crux move.  Tom Isaacson




        By  Anonymous CowardMay 8, 2002


        I climbed this yesterday and was able to figure out the (yes, very footwork intensive - look around for awhile to find the key nubbin) 11a crux of the first pitch - but ended up falling three times on the 10c crux (you can see the huge shelf but how the heck do you reach it!) of the second pitch!  Maybe I just couldn't figure out the moves, but it seemed a degree of magnitude harder then the 11a crux.




        By  Bill WrightMay 9, 2002


        Nice job, AC, on figuring out the 11a face move. I've only followed this pitch once and I didn't figure it out. I think the runout above this move is horrendously scary looking. I need to follow this pitch once move before I'd lead it.  On the second pitch, the key is matching on a small, insecure hold up and right. You get it with your right hand first, then delicately step up and match - very insecure. This move is hard, but not as baffling as the move on the first pitch. At least for me. I've led this second pitch before and followed it and haven't fallen off this move. If you fell three times, it must have been a descent fall since the gear is well below your feet as you reach for this ledge. How'd the fall turnout? Did you fall on the fixed pin or put in a higher RP?




        By  Joe CollinsSep 23, 2002


        I did the first pitch of this (Wide Country) the other day and I have to say that the section past the bolt is one of the hardest low-11's I've done at Eldo.  The 10ish section above at the overlap is exciting.  The 'hand-sized cam' that protects this section is a bit sketchy as it is wedged against a loose block.  However, the block doesn't flex, nor does it look like it's going anywhere.  One can back this piece up with a bomber yellow alien up and left (if you are tall enough to reach the placement).  An awesome pitch!




        By  Anonymous CowardSep 26, 2002


        The Wide Country pitch would be 11d/12a as a Boulder Canyon sport climb

        2nd PITCH HAS LOST A FLAKE: Today (6/29/04), I fell about 15 feet above the belay on the 2nd pitch (variation to the right), and my two cams pulled off a medium-sized flake.  This was not the main undercling/lieback feature that you follow the the right, but a smaller undercling flake above the main one.  I don't believe it will affect the overall rating of the climb, as the route really goes to the right of the flake before traversing back left above it.  It does eliminate a couple of protection opportunities (which apparently weren't very good).  Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare.  The flake landed in his lap, and is now sitting fairly securely on the ledge up and left of the belay.  I'd hate to thing what would have happened if that sucker had fell to the road!

        The LK initial carving comment is truly interesting trivia. I'l have to figure out where ol' RB made his mark.

        Very entertaining and great clues, Steve!  Hopefully it will pique the curiosity of a new generation of Eldo history afficionados....but isnt the answer to the last clue a different climb, namely Rosy? I haven't seen the film in many years, but I seem to recal the incident that I think you're referring to occurring on the traverse.

        Here is the story as told by PA in High Over Boulder:"I was wearing a pair of big mountain boots which Cub Schaefer gave me to try out on rock. I was using a stretchy nylon rope I didn't trust, I was belayed by a 14 year old kid I wasn't sure could catch me, I had no chalk. I had to hammer in all the pitons climbers today have the benefit of clipping, and I managed to climb the 5.11 move my first try. Dalke told me he'd done the upper section of the dihedral free and that it wasn't much harder than 5.8. So when I got the hard moves, and as all of my assorted adversities began to wear me out, and giving myself the benefit of the doubt that I could--under normal circumstances--lead 5.8, I started resting on carabiners on relatively moderate moves. Perhaps I shouldn't have listed it as the ffa. When people complained that I had cheated or been dishonest or some such, I returned and climbed the pitch in much more exact style."  Also, Bob, I think you meant to type DH instead of DK.  The old days are fun to reminisce.  By the way, Steve, do you remember when and where we first met??




        By  Greg HandFrom: Golden, CONov 16, 2004


        Steve,  I was climbing at the Gunk's with Howard Doyle and we came across a crumpled mess at the base of Karma Sutra. I don't remember the date but I am sure you do.  Greg

        "So anybody want to name the climb, and where the RB initials are located on the climb??"  Steve - isn't it on Vertigo, and the intials are at the belay below the direct finish roof?  That's where I see those initials in my mind's eye, anyway.  You can send me a bag of your left-over halloween candy for a prize if I got it correct  :-)

        I first did the DNF around 1978 when I followed Rich Goldstone up it. Rich also led me up Rain which seemed pretty bold in that pre-cam period.  Did the first pitch yesterday in much worse style. The approach was fine. Lots of gear, but a bit dicey at the bottom. The crux was frustrating. It looks pretty easy, but the problem is, I think, the holds, although in reach, are in the wrong places and the balance and sequence are difficult. After a few falls and hangs, I tightened my shoes and did it, only to get pretty scared on the easier ground. Got a tiny brass high (that later fell out) and moved far left. Good gear the rest of the way. The 10 finish seemed straightforward. Strong winds and dropping temperatures convinced us to abandon our plan to continue to the top.  The crux is a bit problematic for the second because a fall swings you far left. Next time I'll climb double ropes (as I did this time) and after the crux not clip the right hand rope until the end of the 10 finish. This should provide a good TR for the second.

        This is far and away the best line I've done on the Bastille.  An elegant and sustained directissima.

        Very excellent route. The climbing is very continuous throughout all pitches with varying degrees of difficulty on all. Above the crux on P1 is pretty spicy! I balked numerous times over the course of many minutes but finally wiggled in a #2 BD stopper and 000 C3 and did the moves. Pretty decent distance above the pin without this gear.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Madame Guillotine is a fine sport pitch on the clean, blank-looking face between Werk Supp and Bastille Crack.   Start up Marie Antoinette, a thin crack just to the right of Werk Supp that ends about 20' up. Where the crack ends, embark on a long, rising, bolt-protected traverse to the right (crux). The climbing here is very typical of Eldo: you either have a decent handhold, or a decent foothold, but rarely both!  Before reaching Bastille Crack, continue straight up past more bolts on fun, thin face climbing (5.11). After the last bolt, trend right to meet up with Bastille Crack just below its second belay.  There are a few worthy variations:  If you want a short, single pitch of hard climbing, you can do the crux of MG past the first 4 bolts, and then traverse right into the crux of the Northcutt Start, and finish at the two bolt anchor on that route.  If you want a long, but somewhat easier pitch, you can climb Marie Antoinette through it's crux runout (5.9X), up to the bolt on that route, and then traverse up and right to join the upper half of Madame Guillotine (5.11). Belay on Bastille Crack.  The proudest link-up would be Madame Guillotine into Hairstyles and Attitudes!Protection Many draws and a light rack.   I used a yellow Alien getting up to the first bolt, and then a green and a red Camalot to make the belay on the Bastille Crack at the end of the pitch (fixed pin here as well).

        A few more variations for those looking to enjoy the upper 5.11 section of MG:  You can start on the Northcutt Start, and continue up the thin corner to start clipping bolts on MG. You can also Climb Werk Supp to Nexus into the upper 3 bolts of MG.  All are great variation pitches on good rock!

        News Flash - All nine bolts on Madame Guillotine were recently replaced. All new bolts are 1/2" x 4.75" stainless Powers 5-piece. Allegedly completed by masked bandits with bad attitudes and a beat up Bosch.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is another "classic" .11- on the north side of the Bastille.    Start near the base of Rain on the (surprising) northwest corner of the Bastille.  Climb up and left via underclings, past a few fixed pins and one tricky move to the top of the pillar and a two bolt anchor (.9).  The next pitch climbs up the left-facing corner, through a small roof (.9+) and up the thin crack (crux). Reach up to clip a bolt and traverse right to a belay at a bolt on the arete.  Pitch three follows the obvious corner above for 40 feet. Move up and right through loose strata to overhung moves along a chalked flake (more pins). Belay on same ledge as for Outer Space.  Pitch four options include outer space and traversing right and up the last pitch of West Buttress.  Overall, this is an enjoyable route.  The crux pitch may feel a little hard for the grade.Protection Standard rack.

        On the crux P2 there are several ways to go from the fixed pins in the thin crack: 1) up the thin crack, 2) a long reach right to a good hold and then a balancy move up to a bolt, or 3) downclimbing a body-length to traverse  right then up. This last sounds convoluted but the  leader will frequently downclimb to get a rest after clipping the pins (or just placing a bombproof small cam) anyway, and this traverse is better if you don't  have a long wingspan.   In any case, I launched up on this once when I wasn't climbing too well, placed the small cam (before the  pins were placed by Chris Archer), traversed out to the 'mantle hold' and lobbed off. It's a surprisingly comfortable fall. ...so much so that I went up and  lobbed off again. I hope this little story serves to encourage people to go up on this classic pitch with  less trepidation.




        By  Tom FyffeNov 12, 2001


        This is a really good route. The crux pitch is a classic shit or get off the pot scenario, but very do-able.




        By  TBDJun 1, 2002


        Fun Climb.  On the crux pitch, the traverse after the crux moves feels a little dicey, if you fall, you'll swing (but on a good bolt).  Also, the fixed pin prior to pulling the small roof to the belay bolt is questionable at best, back it up.  As with all other gear routes on the planet, small aliens are helpful.  The most obvious finish to me was Outer Face, definitely worthwhile.




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 13, 2002


        I climbed this route yesterday and loved it. I did however get pretty sketched out on the 3rd pitch when I pulled on a large flake in the 5.9 section and it moved. The pro at this point is a pin driven behind the same flake. I found it difficult to make the move without yarding straight out on the suspect flake. I also had a hard time clipping the pin just below this one because of the way it sits in the rock, I was standing on some loose strata trying to make this clip. I found the crux 2nd pitch to be very difficult and got spit off a few times but will return to try again since the pro is very good through this section. As Steve said, the fall is clean, I went slightly left after the last pin at the crux..




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 13, 2002


        That's usually done as the third pitch, and yes, be really careful on that shattered band.  Have a Petzl biner handy to clip the difficult pin.  Not a place to be pushing things, regardless of how one approaches the crux pitch...




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 19, 2002


        Your'e right "AC", it was the third pitch and it is no place to push things, I'd say this pitch is more serious than the crux........




        By  Andrew KleinJul 3, 2002


        Has anyone done this route in 2 pitches with a 60m.  Me and my partner came close the other day.  I lead the third, fourth and the easy chimney pitch above and right form the outer space ledge and came about 15 feet short form the top (walk-off ledge).  My partner belayed right after the .9 undercling roof after the crux, because of drag, but still had about 30 feet or so of rope left.  I, of course (on the crux pitch) did the easier variation to the right after the second pin which is a good option for someone following the pitch who wants to keep the climbing easier.  I remember staying in the crack the whole way when I did this last year (following) and remember getting really pumped and hanging quite a bit trying to find some decent feet.  Excellent route and mostly great 5.9 climbing except the crux 25-30 feet.




        By  Dougald MacDonaldAug 1, 2002


        Now that I've  (FINALLY!) led  the  crux without a problem, I think this is a great route. Before it was negative-five stars. If  you're weak, like me, don't stint on gear for  the traverse from the bolt to the belay (assuming you've taken the left variation). You can clip the second bolt at your knees with a long sling. And be  sure to back up the pin at  the end. The exit is not trivial!




        By  Bill WrightAug 29, 2002


        I climbed this route yesterday and it is indeed a great route. On the 3rd pitch, mentioned above, I have some comments. First, the loose flakes are not where the pins are driven. These flakes seemed completely solid to me. Yes, the first pin is difficult to clip and have a small biner for this (Neutrinos work here). The loose flakes below this are a bit freaky but they can be avoided. This section is steep, but short and didn't seem too serious (if the pins hold and they seemed good to me).  The start of the crux pitch is a bit disgusting right now with pigeon shit. Thankfully this only lasts for about ten feet, but it sucks having to fist jam this crack with that shit in there.  I followed the crux pitch and fell off it. What worked best for me was to do the long reach left from the best hold in the crack. This hold is rather low. Then the key is to reach as far as possible on the hold out to the right. Not only is it a better hold the further you reach, but it gives you room to match your right hand on it. This match is by far the crux move on the route, but it is followed with a dicy move to get your foot on this hold and a fall from here would be exciting, though supposedly safe.




        By  Scott ConnerFrom: Lyons, COAug 29, 2002


        Jeez Bill!  You need to be careful!  If one of your calf muscles popped out from three pitches up, it could seriously hurt someone down below.




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 1, 2003


        I did this route again yesterday and the flake I mentioned above does flex if you pull on it...




        By  Evan SloaneFrom: BoulderAug 11, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_1913644906').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Instead of trending right on the last pitch into the 5.7 finish, do the Outer Face pitch (see separate route listing). This pitch keeps the grade more consistent with the rest of the route and allows you to really follow the prow from base to summit. Good fun.




        By  Mark RothFrom: BoulderMar 16, 2009


        Is the loose rock removed?  Is the route open now?




        By  blakeherringtonApr 15, 2009


        P1/P2  can be linked. From atop p2, a ~65m pitch goes to the summit. I thought that the crux, if climbed straight up, then rightward (long reach to pin scar and desperate pull) felt harder than 5.11a. My partner worked right and then up (past one more pin and another new bolt) and said it felt less strenuous.




        By  Kat AFrom: Bart and Lisa Ville, COJun 26, 2009


        Good to hear Steve Levin's comment on how the 3rd pitch has become more difficult to reach the fixed pin since removal of the block.  Felt scary trying to lock off on one arm, heel hook, and stretch up to the pin just to find my Superfly biner wouldn't fit through the hanger, as I was hanging above sharp loose rocks... maybe there's an easier way to do it (?).




        By  Mike McKinnonFrom: Golden, COJul 27, 2009


        I think I do this different than everyone else. First, the XM start is much nicer and adds another 10 pitch to the climb.  On the crux, I climb over the tiny roof and get my left hand in the good slot between the two pins in the crack. Then I reach out with my left foot and toe in on a tiny edge (out left) and balance forward on that while moving my left hand high and right hand to a gaston in the crack above the pins. My left hand hits a high edge and I pop my feet up and move to better holds right under the bolt. Clip the bolt and move right.  Voila




        By  MontyAdministratorFrom: Golden, COSep 10, 2012$(function(){$('#stars_2070984544').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        While cleaning the crux pitch, my partner effortlessly pulled out the pin that "protected" the crux.  Luckily, great gear abounds!




        By  mtoensingFrom: BoulderMar 21, 2014$(function(){$('#stars_1635832988').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Rock climbing at its best!




        By  Bob RotertApr 29, 2015


        Did this today and found the top pin that protected the straight up thin crack version and has been there for 15 plus years is missing. I always thought it looked pretty solid, but I see in a post above that it came out when someone was cleaning the pitch. I don't doubt that it has been fallen upon many times in the past, but over the years with freeze thaw, these things can loosen.  This seemed to me, at the time, that it changes the route quite a bit from when the pin was there. I am in a climbing recovery mode and not really on my game right now, but it seemed like It adds quite a bit more commitment, since that pin used to be quite high in the crack and close to waist level when doing the crux. The crack is pretty flaring in this section, I couldn't get anything good passive pro in up high in the crack, plus it's a very strenuous place to try and place anything, which was the reason why the pin was there to begin with. Getting any good gear in high in the crack, where the pin was, would be difficult if possible at all. You can get a green Alien in just above the existing pin. Seems to me it would be good if some one replaced the pin that feel out. That would return this route to its previous, more friendly character. Or maybe it's not that bad, just not what I was expecting?  08/17/16 update: Now the other pin that was there that was below the green Alien placement I mention above has broken. Part of the pin is still in the crack. I know some may not agree with me, but I am just sayin' what was once a pretty friendly and safe climb, with the pins there, has a much higher commitment and risk factor now.




        By  Brett S.From: ColoradoMay 31, 2015


        Hey Bob, I climbed the route last summer not knowing that there was ever a pin protecting the upper part of the thin crack, and it felt pretty safe. I placed several pieces just below the crack and gunned it through the crux to the bolt. As you say, placing protection in the seam would be strenuous, and honestly, I didn't see any great options. The fall would be pretty big if you came off towards the top of the crack, but I believe it would be safe. The cams below the crack are very good placements.




        By  Robert Daniel.From: Denver, ColoradoJun 11, 2016$(function(){$('#stars_1454932771').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Just want to re-iterate the importance of having a smaller biner ready to go to clip the first pin on the 3rd pitch.




        By  Kishen MangatAug 16, 2016


        Climbed this super route again today. A couple notes - I used a yellow (0.2) BD X4 on the  placement at the base of the P2 crux below the bolt. It was fine, but I would have preferred a green Alien. I linked pitch 2 & 3 and had horrendous rope drag by the time I reached the Outer Sspace ledge. Probably better to break it up. Have fun!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This sensational pitch, formerly called Space Invaders II, parallels the last pitch of Outer Space, about 25 feet to the left.  The simplest and fastest approach is to get to the top of the third pitch of the Bastille Crack, belay, and then launch out right along the stratum (~20') to a short, left-facing dihedral.  A line of ring bolts straight up the steep wall above marks the route.  There are two hard sections separated by a good rest with a knee-lock.  The lower section (.11b/c) just gets you warmed up for the upper crux.  You'll execute a series of intricate moves in a short distance in order to set up for the balancy crux moves.  Look for a hidden pocket/dish and then make a couple of big moves to finish it off onto a flat ledge.  From here the route joins the original Space Invaders at .11a, past 3 more bolts (plus small gear) to the top. Concerning the rating, the Eldo guide calls the route .12c/d but nowhere is it any harder than .12b.  The crux is kind of involved but the moves are not hard 5.12.  Using Genesis (.12c) as a yardstick, H&A should be rated quite a bit easier.  Perhaps the stiff rating is more a result of the amazing exposure rather than the actual moves. One of the things that make this route so fun is that it is very well protected.  Combine that with its stunning setting and aesthetic positions, and you've got one of the best pitches in the canyon.  If you climb 5.12 and crave exposure, then this is a must-do route!Protection 10 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.  Gear is needed for approach pitches.

        This route would see way more traffic if it had belay anchors. It's a total pain to rig a belay, unless both climbers climb 12b/c and the second can remove all the crap. A big loose rock is in the way of your feet at the belay as well. It would drop straight down Bastille Crack.




        By  Josh JanesGeneral AdminMar 18, 2009$(function(){$('#stars_291092520').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        I assume you mean the belay at the start of the pitch?  I seem to remember not having too much trouble finding gear there... but we always approached by rapping in from above and setting up the anchor at a natural starting point just up and left from one of the Bastille Crack belays.  When I was working this route, one of my partners, who will remain unnamed and happened to be wearing my bright orange down jacket, had to relieve himself while I was climbing.  Despite my protests he proceeded to urinate right into the Bastille Crack.  A few days later I walked into the BRC and a few staff members jokingly chided "way to go pissing all over the most popular climb in Boulder last weekend!"  "It wasn't me!  I swear!"




        By  Bart PaullFrom: Boulder, COApr 9, 2009


        A good way to set up for this route is to belay about one third of the way up the second pitch of Outer Space, below the start of the prominent dihedral.  This belay takes smallish gear, TCUs, nuts, etc.  From there, climb the dihedral on Outer Space with some long slings, and then cut left onto the bolts of Hairstyles and Attitudes.  Using this method you can take this pitch all the way to the top of the Bastille, and it's one of the best pitches in Eldo!

        FYI:  I obtained a permit to re-bolt this route (the old bolts will be removed and new 1/2" bolts as close as is safe to the old holes).  However, due to a little power drill drama last week there is currently only one new bolt at the top of the route.  Hopefully a new drill or battery pack will magically appear and the changing of the bolts may continue.

        Glad someone is replacing the bolts on this thing, those old ones are annoyingly hard to clip!   One question/concern though: I noticed there's a quicklink and rap ring on the new anchor bolt. Do you think the top anchor needs to be equipped for rapping? I can't really see any reason why you'd need to rap here, and if you're rapping in to approach the pitch, you can just hang a couple draws and retrieve them when you top out.  I guess my concern is that someone with limited knowledge of the route/area will see the anchors and attempt to rap down to the ground, which would be tough. I know the anchors are not super visible from the summit, so it probably won't be a problem, but there doesn't seem to be a reason for having them equipped for raps at all.  Again, thanks a ton for the volunteer work, I don't want to be negative, just thought I'd raise the question. -Scott

        Also, maybe replacing the bolts is not all that necessary... I went out today with my friend Matt and sent this route sans bolts, all gear. It's not really super runout, I did TR a few times first, but it could probably be done ground-up by a 5.12 climber. It actually felt easier this way, since you don't have to clip any bolts during the crux.  -Scott

        I belayed Scott on the all gear send today, it was sick!! He ran it out 20 feet on a so so number 6... that's right, you heard me, he climbed that bitch with a number six swinging from his harness. Good work, Holmes.




        By  MadaleineFrom: Boulder, ColoradoJul 31, 2009


        This route has been equipped with new, 1/2" and 3 1/2" bolts.  Not all the old ring bolts have been removed, and will be within a month or so.  The bolts were replaced as they were first installed, with rap rings at the top and one new bolt at the belay from below.   *ALSO**, a new, bright yellow static rope is "MISSING."  I left it up there for over 2 weeks in the dark, deep recess/crack at the top-out.  pls. return this to the ranger station or email me. If it was stolen, WOW and good karma to you.....and it's actually a dynamic rope so you should go out and take some whippers.




        By  Blake CashFrom: Chattanooga, TNNov 10, 2009


        Thanks for all the hard work, Madaleine.  This is on my list of routes to do for the winter here in the FRange.  Karma will come around to whoever stole your rope.    So, there is a belay bolt for this thing?  If one were to rap down the route, it would be pretty obvious, yes?

        Yes, there's a bolt at the lower belay (the start of the pitch). It will be obvious rapping down. This would be a cold winter route, though, good luck. -Scott




        By  Adam ScheerMar 21, 2011


        This is a great climb that is now a little harder due to one less hold before the crux.  I pulled off a flake about a foot long and 4" wide from the rotten band.  Judging from the chalk, I wasn't the only one to be using this hold.  Establishing on the headwall below the crux is still in the realm of 5.11+, you may just need to figure out new beta.   	  	              	      	  	    I pulled off this bad boy from the rotten band a little above the kneebar rest.  The flake dangerously flexed when I used the crimp to help establish on the headwall before the crux.




        By  Brady RobinsonOct 8, 2012


        Thanks to 3 recent sorties by members of the Action Committee for Eldorado, all old ring bolts are now removed, holes are pretty well camouflaged. Also, rings were added to the anchor at the bottom just in case anyone were to rap from there. FYI, those old ring bolts are a pain to remove. A Dremel tool with lots of batteries and lots and lots of fiber cutting wheels was the ticket, much easier than a reciprocating saw or hand saw. Pulling them out by force seems like a bad idea - forces are great enough to damage the rock.  Big thanks to Madaleine for replacing the ring bolts. A multi-year team effort hopefully resulted in a pitch that gets more attention now. And now that Madame Guillotine's bolts have been replaced, the epic 5.12 link-up is ready for all suitors!

        Take care at the belay station below the climb.  There's a detached brick in the crack below and left of the anchors.  Your left foot and this doomstone will be playing footsy.  Excellent trundle candidate, but clear the road.




        By  Mike McHughApr 26, 2013


        Thanks to two brave souls from ACE, the footsy block has been gently lowered to the road.




        By  MontyAdministratorFrom: Golden, COAug 12, 2014 rating:  5.12 7b+ 27 VIII+ 26 E6 6b$(function(){$('#stars_393567573').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Now that the footsy block has been removed from the lower anchor (THANKS GUYS!), a decent stance can be made by placing a 0.4 size piece in the crack to the left of the anchor and clipping in short.  Thanks again to everyone who has helped rebolt, dremmel, and trundle, this is an awesome rock climb!




        By  HealyjeFrom: PDXApr 1, 2016


        Strayed onto this by accident with in 1975 with just a few stoppers and a novice partner belaying me, and it's the closest I've ever come to dying while climbing. Managed to get off of it alive, but just barely. Interesting and not surprising to see it didn't get done until 13 years later - definitely burly with some sketch pro.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description From the top of NW Corner, move up to the top of the sloping belay ledge. Wander up the prow above looking for pro and occasionally finding it.  Expect some runouts and sub-optimal placements, do not expect any chalk.  Belay on top of the Bastille.  This is a great direct finish for Northwest Corner.Location Start is 3-4 pitches up the Bastille on the ledge that serves as a belay for Outer Space, Northwest Corner, Hair City, etc.  The route is to the right of Outer Face and finishes at the top of the Bastille.  Walk off to the south and downclimb to the Fowler Trail, then down the steep trail along the west side of the Bastille to the road.Protection Standard rack to a #3 (blue) Camalot.  No fixed gear or anchors.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description The only reason I give this 3 stars is because the line is disjunct and it doesn't really go anywhere.  However the climbing is excellent, certainly as good as many other 4 star routes.  The route starts near the NE corner of the Bastille, right off the road and about 50 feet east of the Bastille Crack.  Walk just past the first steep buttress (March of Dimes Buttress--about 50 feet high) that lies on the road, 100 yards or so west of the parking lot.  The route starts just right of a 40 foot, large rotten dihedral formed by the west edge of March of Dimes Buttress.  P1 - Climb up flakes either on the right or the left for 25 feet, and then lieback another shallow flake to a stance 50 feet up.  Follow a beautiful thin crack that jogs gently back and forth, sometimes taking the appearance of a shallow dihedral.  Belay from bolts on a sloping ledge about 140 feet up.  I recommend stepping left to the ledge 5 feet or so before the crack ends (especially if your second isn't solid--the bolts are not on top of the crack).  (5.8+)  P2 - Traverse 15 feet left across the ledge to an obvious, right leaning crack/slot (moving the belay if desired).  Climb that for 50 feet (crux, with perfect hand-jamming and awkward feet).  Belay on another large ledge.  Above is the beautiful 5.10c finger crack of March of Dimes; climb that, or traverse off east.  Be very careful on the descent; we got cliffed and ended up rappelling from a tree.  Possibly go quite a ways east.  Note: Many people do the fantastic first pitch, then rap from the bolts down and east to the top of March of Dimes buttress, where another bolt anchor exists allowing passage to the ground.  Easy to do with a 50 meter rope, and a great end of the day route.  If you have a 70m rope, you can rap all the way to the ground from the P1 bolts.Protection Rossiter suggests up to a #4 Friend, but the whole climb seemed well protected with nothing larger than a #3 (but bring at least 2 of those, and 2 # 2.5).  You could conceivably place a number 4 at the bottom of the crux pitch.  Bring lots of small gear for the first pitch.

        Yes, I made the same mistake on the descent too which made for some tangy downclimbing the steep slope with loose rocks. The correct or easier way is to stay high on the traverse until you see the talus field.   I found that many smaller pieces work best for the first pitch. My largest piece was a #2 Friend until the last move, where I placed a #3 Friend.   On a side note, Myke and I were filmed on this route today (4-30-01) for some climbing instruction program to be aired on a new cable network. We will probably get 5 sec. at the end when they are fading out. ;-)




        By  Tyler JonesJun 11, 2001


        I did both pitches yesterday and I would have to say... the second pitch is VERY STRENUOUS, especially after doing such a long pitch before it.  Absolutely a 9+, if you are not comfortable climbing 9's then don't try it unless you got doubles in the #1 and 2 Camalots.  I also found this climb to be VERY odd from the usual Eldo climbing style.  I can't wait till I have more time to try the next section of March of Dimes (10c)... what a cool lookin' crack.




        By  Erik CorkranJun 12, 2001


        Somehow I never realized that there were bolts on top of the first pitch.  Always did the long runner and belay at base of P2, as someone mentioned.  This is a great route, though personally I don't like the first pitch very well (the 2nd one makes up for it though).




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 13, 2001


        Really??  Wow!  I think the first pitch is one of the best 5.8 pitches in the canyon--I've done it about half a dozen times.  Great for running up at the end of the day.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        Linking this route with the last pitch of March of Dimes is great, and it makes the descent much easier.  Even though pitch two was short, I found myself placing more gear than I usually would only because the ramp on which the belayer sits angles up right quite steeply.  Resultingly, in the the event of a fall, hitting this ledge is quite likely if the leader has run it out at all.  9+ is a good grade for this pitch, but the 10c March of Dimes pitch is a bit overgraded (more like a/b) especially when compared with routes like Bolting for Glory (10a) and Northcutt Start (10d).




        By  Jeff LockyerFrom: Canmore, ABNov 5, 2001


        An Awesome line.. A little bit of everything, jamfest on P2, good fingers on P1, great length on P1. A really superb route. Good grading as well, P2 deserves more credit than it gets, it is a character builder once you get on it. Jump in !!




        By  Aaron ShuppJan 24, 2002


        If you like big cracks, P2 is great.  I haven't found anything quite like it in Eldo.  Eventhough P1 covers some discontinous features, the line is very enjoyable with good quality rock.  I highly recomend it.




        By  Hayden YurkanisMay 31, 2002


        Did the first pitch today...you can sling a horn right when the real climbing begins for good, easy pro (not the two obvious horns below it). An all around 3 star pitch--and long.




        By  Chris ChlebowskiJun 14, 2002


        The first pitch is easily one of the nicest pieces of rock I have EVER been on. Gorgeous line, good pro and astheitcally pleasing. Climb this thing. I think it deserves three stars:)




        By  James BalasalleSep 30, 2002$(function(){$('#stars_714548669').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I agree with everyone, the first pitch is a really great climb.  The pitch is varied, interesting and fairly sustained.  The protection at the bottom of the route looked a little bit sketchy, although I didn't lead the route.  But I thought the harder, upper moves were well protected.  I really look forwared to leading this pitch.  I think the first pitch is rated 8+ in Rossiter's guide, and I would say that's right on.




        By  Anonymous CowardOct 7, 2002


        If this pitch isn't 3 stars, I don't know what is ...




        By  Anonymous CowardMay 19, 2003


        .... there are many flakes to hang a rope on, not to mention the rocks perched on top of P1 March of Dimes.  I'm sure it is possible to rap directly from the anchors atop P1 Werk Supp, but doing it in 2 shorter raps significantly reduces the chance of something going wrong.




        By  Dr. DanFrom: Steamboat Springs, COJul 1, 2003


        Before I led P2 I was given some beta on gear, which included taking a couple of Metolius #3s and a #4.  The only gear I used, and felt very secure, were #1s and #2s.  It is not actually an off-width, but a solid, be it awkward, hand crack.  Because of the right leaning and downward direction of the crack, it leaves your body hanging and your right foot smearing most of the way.




        By  Shane ZentnerFrom: ColoradoJul 7, 2003$(function(){$('#stars_342337534').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        I didn't place anything bigger than a #3 Camalot near the crux(the offwidth is too flared for anything bigger.) Solid at the grade and burly.  Laybacking caused me to barndoor and fall several times. Maybe a combination of jamming and laybacking would work.  Well worth the effort and fun to do.




        By  Hayden YurkanisJul 17, 2003


        The second pitch, although shorter, is much sweeter than the first...very physical hand jamming, don't rappel after the first pitch!! Crack climbers will eat this pitch alive.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoJul 24, 2003


        Small cams will sew this up...good stems, jams, and laybacks on P1.  Pretty sustained for (8) climbing...thoughtful moves in a few setions, but its all there.  A great, long, worthy first pitch...looking forward to continuing up P2 in the near future.




        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COSep 11, 2003$(function(){$('#stars_1346330890').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Pitch 1 has got to be my favorite 5.8 pitch in the whole canyon.  Climbed it at lunch today and we were the only climbers on the Bastille.  If this isn't 4 stars, I'm not sure what is!




        By  David ConlinOct 23, 2003$(function(){$('#stars_1934716097').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I led this route and finished with March of Dimes yesterday. All 3 pitches are stellar, in my opinion.  P1: sustained 8+, very enjoyable, a little runout after the first piece. Bring plenty of small-medium cams (i.e. 0.2-0.75 Camalot equivs.) and larger nuts. Definitely belay from below P2, rather than at the bolt anchor.  P2: I loved this pitch and felt more secure on it than on P1. I don't know what the + is doing in the rating. Maybe it is hand-size dependent, but I didn't find this particularly hard, and it is short. There are good feet on the right face and in the crack and the hand jams are bomber. I would say 5.9, no plus. It is easy to continue onto March of Dimes without stopping for a belay, although this may have been my downfall (I fell on the 10c crux) as I was kind of pumped after the first two pitches. May have benifitted from a rest before tackling MoD. Gear: I placed Camalots 4, 0.5, 3, 2, 1 BUT I think a 4 is unnecessary and a 3 would have been better in that placement.  P3: (March of Dimes) Hard, for me anyway. Tricky feet and crimpy hands up high. Used small nuts and Yellow and Green aliens (equiv. to BD 0.3, 0.2 I think), the latter of which held multiple lead falls before I figured out the sequence. My partner, Mike Flanagan flashed it though. The belay atop is weird. Sling a root, good BD #2, poor BD#3 (would have been better with bigger cam).

        Trail another rope or use it for double rope gear (better idea) and you can rap to the ground from the chains ten feet east of the ledge you end up on after pitch one.   Was going to aid this today but we had a nice break in the cold snap and it went On Sight free on lead. I placed enough gear for aid (double ropes) should my girlfriend need it, but she toughed it out. REALLY classic first pitch. I'd do this three or four times a year for a quick run up a fun yet challenging route, especially if the Bast. Crack  is a traffic jam. Easy climbing lets you top off the beast after pitch one anyway...   For gear, double up on nuts #7-9, double green Aliens-2" cams. For an anchor on a direct line with the first pitch, bring a pink tri-cam #9 BD stopper, and appropriate cams. You can set up an equalized anchor in the wide finger slot just after the cruxy overhang with accompanying finger-tip crack. If you're bailing after this, belay down to the chains and rap directly to the base. OR simul the rest of the broken ramp to top out the rock quickly.  Can't wait for the warm weather!~Wm

        Goodness...Concerning the gear on this route, I recommended WAY too much. Doubling cams from green Aliens-2" is insane considering the weight you're carrying. Remember that I set enough gear for AID. This is when double ropes are recommended, NOT for a free ascent. This is not an Indian Creek varying crack, so don't gear up for that. Just bring a standard Eldo rack (but include some small cams and hexes. They will help). Thanks Leo. ~Wm

        Great moves until getting to bolt anchor (following) loose flakes and a little polished for first 40' or so.

        I recently climbed Werk Supp again. This time around I used left hand crimpers on the face and jammed with my right hand in the crack (laybacking will make you barndoor). Look for the rail near top left of the crack. Led the last pitch of March of Dimes from here-medium stopper, blue Alien, green Alien, blue Metolius.




        By  StichFrom: Colorado Springs, ColoradoSep 8, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_1993043409').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I got to lead P1 for the first time today and found it to be exceptionally good. I ran out of the right size nuts towards the top. I can't honestly say what else could make this pitch better! It certainly deserves 3 stars.




        By  JeremyFrom: Boulder, COSep 29, 2004 rating:  5.9+ 5c 17 VI 17 E1 5a$(function(){$('#stars_887798611').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I agree with Tim. Stellar first pitch! No approach, great climbing with sweet finger locks, and a quick rap off.




        By  Kevin CurriganFrom: LakewoodOct 5, 2004 rating:  5.9 5c 17 VI 17 HVS 5a$(function(){$('#stars_530472122').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I vote (it's that time of year) for 5.9 on the second pitch.  It's short but good stances to place pro above the offwidth are not there, and the climbing is sustained.




        By  Jason ShatekDec 31, 2004 rating:  5.8+ 5b 16 VI- 15 HVS 4c$(function(){$('#stars_650640430').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Climbed P1 today -- I thought the 5.8+ rating was right on.  Beautiful sustained climbing with plenty of gear placement opportunities.  We took 2 full sets of aliens and I used everyone along with 13 runners and various other pieces.  Big gear is good to use in the first 30 feet but not a requirement.  Also, a 60m rope for rappel gets you to about 10 feet off the ground to an easy down climb.  I placed a perfect red Alien right in the crux but also found that I needed that hand hold.  Next time I would use a stopper or something.  Great route!




        By  Anonymous CowardJan 1, 2005


        Sure.  From the top of WS pitch one (the lovely finger crack), cruise easily up the ramp to the right and enter a short but awkward dihedral (5.6; may be a fixed pin here).  You will arrive at the belay on top of BC pitch 3.




        By  Scott ConnerFrom: Lyons, COJan 1, 2005$(function(){$('#stars_124353415').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Larry,   I've done this a few times and it links up fine.  There is one tricky and awkward 5.8ish spot with poor pro (an old pin, I think) and quite a bit of loose rock but it goes...    The second pitch of WS gears up very well and is short.  Go for it... when you're ready...




        By  StichFrom: Colorado Springs, ColoradoApr 13, 2005$(function(){$('#stars_1258606847').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Since a rappel on a 60m rope will get you down within 10 feet of the ground with stretch, it's obviously not at 140-150 ft. pitch. I'd put it closer to 105 ft. Vertical distances are usually overestimated.




        By  Anonymous CowardApr 26, 2005


        Larry, I think the ramp from the top of P1 on Werk Supp to the P2/P3 pitch of the Bastille Crack goes at 5.8ish if you stay to the left its 5.6ish with crappy pro if you go to the right its 5.8ish with better pro and an old pin at the crux; I think the route is called "Shatek's Ramp-age."

        Named by Ament because the climb works up (i.e. wers up) in difficulty the higher you go.  Find an old copy of High Over Boulder to read Pat's comments.




        By  Michael KullmanMay 6, 2005


        My .02 cents - p1 is great fun, a perfect challenge for anyone comfortable on 5.8ish routes. Several thought provoking sections between good stances. I was glad to have lots of small gear, I used all of it. First 30' or so has kinda sketchy pro, after that it's solid.

        This is a great climb and well worth doing. Pitch one and two could not be more different. Pitch one is thoughtful and balence-oriented while pitch two is deep-set slammer hands. For what it's worth, P2 [reminded] me of [Pool of Blood]. For the walk-off: head east down a ramp system, you'll see a tree with slings-don't go there, instead climb up a short corner and then down a very easy ramp to the talus.

        If you're going to do the first pitch, then you have to do the second. That's where all the excitement is! Getting swallowed up by that fat crack is great!

        This would be a **** route if there was some kind of fixed anchor either atop the 10c March o' Dimes pitch, or above p2 of Werksupp.  Summitting above here takes a lot of time and walking, the "East Face" isn't fun to descend either.

        I followed pitch one and I thought it was quite interesting and somewhat typical Eldo style with traversing and steep face with the occasional crack feature for gear and what not.  Pretty sporty; sustained and a bit bold, I don't think I would have enjoyed to lead it.    P2. Was mine and I was a bit nervous with anticipation of the awkward looking crack but also eager to get on it and learn something.  I got up and placed 2 cams and got pretty pumped trying to see how to get up the akward section onto the stance in the first pod, I came off and grabbed a cam to keep from decking as my belayer was back at the chains of pitch 1 and there would have been a bit of rope stretch.    I lowered to the ground and started again after looking it over a bit.  I got into the first rest stance in the pod and got some more gear, and kept working the hands/ wide hands crack through the pods getting gear and an awkward rest occasionally.  I plugged a #1 near what seemed the crux and ran it out to the ledge with the tree on the far side.  Both I and my partner found this to be stout for the grade and definitely sustained for the short pitch it was.  The thing seems to want to spit you out the whole time, and there isn't much out side of the crack to keep you in so you just have to work the jambs, keep moving and keep an eye out for holds on either side of the crack when the going gets rough.   We took MOD for the third pitch and both had some trouble with it seems stout to me, bout as hard as Northcutt Start on BC for sure IMO. We continued up the OW directly above and over to the last pitch of BC, good fun! Pretty sure I used my 3.5 and #4 on p2. and my partner wanted the #4 on the OW above the finger crack on MOD.




        By  Phil PerssonFrom: Denver, ColoradoSep 28, 2008


        Fantastic; in all honestly the first pitch my be my favorite trad line anywhere; fantastic, varied, and sustained climbing makes this a classic moderate.  Just when things start to feel a little hairy one of the magic "wrap your hand around" flakes of a bomber finger jam appears.  Eat's TCUs and C3s for breakfast.  We found with a 70m rope and some rope management [read: long slings] you can get to the top of the Bastille via the end of Bastille Crack from the Werk Supp PI anchors in one pitch, which makes for a great afternoon jaunt if time is scarce.

        I just did pitch 1 for an end of the day climb and found it to be fantastic and varied. I was in the midst of it, 90 feet up, and remembered why I love rock climbing so much. It is thoughtful, balancy, and simply sweet! Or maybe I just love finger cracks. Eats up nut placements.

        I just don't know. I floated the crux pitch of Handcracker Direct, which is supposedly a 5.10a handcrack. Then I jump on the second pitch of this, a 5.9ish hand crack. Which one should be harder? I guess I really suck at crack climbing....sometimes.

        Beta question for P1.    Whenever I see people leading this, their first piece appears to be about 20-25 feet above the ground.   Why?  Is there no gear before then?   Is the rock just not worth placing gear in?  If so, then what would you rate the difficulty of the first section of the climb before the finger crack.  Despite the fact there is no "R" rating on this climb, I am leary to lead it because I am not a fan of routes that have no pro near the ground.  Although that is a common characteristic for Eldo routes :-).  Any thoughts would be welcome.  Regards,  Drew

        Drew, in my experience (have led pitch 1 3 times that I can think of), I've found the climbing up to the finger crack to be much easier than the rest of the route, maybe 5.7, climbing is on big holds.  Much of the initial section is expando rock and some people might not bother to place gear but there are some decent possibilities.  I seem to remember a good pin or 2 that also inspired some confidence.  The pro at the crux is bomber and I don't feel the R rating is warranted.  Just my 2 cents though.

        Thanks, David.  That's all I needed to go fire it up this morning.    I led both pitches.  I was able to get some "okay" gear in before the pin.   The pin is not really needed, but I clipped it anyway.   Super fun and intricate moves in the finger crack.     I ended up peeling off on P2 after pulling out of the funky pod half way up the pitch.  Then finished it off clean.  I would recommend 2 #1 Camalots for the P2 hand crack.   Also bring a #2, a #3 and leave the #4 at home (or use it for the P2 belay).  What a classic route!  Get on it if you have not yet :)  Drew

         The first time I did this route was in 1979, back then I could not afford cams. Didn't trust them either, they were new and looked unreliable. Hey, I was climbing trad, my shoes were PAs if anybody remembers them.   P1 was wonderful, sustianed but not too difficult. P2 was a bit more commited. I was able to get a #8 hex in at the "slot". I did not trust it but continued on anyway. Ten feet above it I peeled! Falling head over heels backwards, chalk raining down like snow. My belayer held me two feet above the belay ledge!  The #8 hex held!! I could not believe it! So I smoked a ciggarette to calm the nerves and made it on my second try. I love that climb!

        About the rating: Pat Ament, Rossiter, and Levin's guides all give P2 a 9+ (Ament did the FA). To the extent that any climb actually has a rating, Werk Supp does, and it's 9+, not 9. If it feels easier than 9+, congratulations, you're climbing well.

        On March 25, 2012, we apparently left a red Alien on or at the bottom of the first pitch of Werk Supp.  Reward and good karma for its safe return!  Email jyatesatwork@yahoo.com.

        P2 was my first Eldo 5.9 lead.  Onsight.  Nice hand jams but tricky insecure feet and positioning.    Stay high on the walk of to the east.  We almost got lured down too soon.

        I did just the first pitch today as a last climb before heading home.  I loved the climbing!  I wish I had brought more small gear (BD #0-0.2) as the finger crack at the top of the climb was more challenging with just placing nuts.  I used up my smaller gear lower on the climb.  Although a #4 is not necessary, I did place one toward the bottom of the climb.  I rapped from the bolts using a 70 meter rope and got to the ground with very little to spare.  You NEED a 70m to do this!

        As per the above: to rap to the ground from there, yes, you need a 70m. However, you can rap the route with a 50m if you go to the station to climber's left on top of the March Of Dimes pillar as described in the topos and this route description.

        P2 is a little slice of Vedauwoo in Eldo, super rad hand jams all the way, some big, some small, I think the crux could be almost anywhere on the route depending on your hand size.

        Excellent route! Did the second pitch on the second time, had to come back and give it another go, well worth it! No need for cams bigger then Camalot #3 on second pitch, first pitch ate small gear like crazy.

        Replaced the Werk Supp anchor early this morning. It had 3/8" x 3" carbon stud bolts that were getting rusty. Now it has 1/2" x 4.75" SS 5-piece bolts with SS hangers. I put the old chains back on, but plan to upgrade those to SS also soon.




        By  Kyle PJun 8, 2015


        Thanks, Gregger for the chains, much appreciated. Just a short PSA in regard to rappelling Werk Supp: if rapping the route with a 70m rope or double ropes from the top of pitch 1 (i.e. in one rap), please be sure to rap directly over the top of the March of Dimes buttress. You will rap directly over the chains on top of pitch 1 of MoD. Do NOT descend via the gully between MoD and Werk Supp. That gully is stacked with large, loose boulders. When dislodged, those boulders will find their way to the base of Werk Supp (where there is often a belayer) and/or into the road. We were unfortunate enough to be at the base when a climber chose the loose gully and kicked loose a microwave size block, which triggered several other large rocks to tumble down to the road. No one was hurt, but it was a good reminder: 1) to always wear a helmet everywhere in eldo 2) that even 2 minutes from the car, there are loose rocks on routes/raps that see enormous traffic.  Please stay out of that gully!  Kyle

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is my favorite route on the Bastille. The last pitch is steep and one of the most spectacular pitches in Eldo.  Begin with the first pitch of the Bastille Crack to the belay below the 5.7 second pitch. From this belay, traverse right around a bulge to directly below an obvious, chalked dihedral. Do a sketchy .9+ move to get to a rest at the base of this dihedral. Next, clip a pin and climb the steep dihedral via stems and good jams (.10a), once at the top, traverse right on a ledge to a belay at the base of the crux undercling section. For the crux, place a good, small stopper before stepping off the ledge, and climb over dicey terrain to an undercling hold with a pin in it. Clip this pin, and use the undercling to move left around a corner (crux) and move up the crack system for 60 feet. This crack has many 5.9-5.9+ sections between good rests, the exposure on this pitch is incredible.  Follow the crack left to a short juggy wall and top out on the top of the Bastille. Protection Rossiter gives this route a runout rating. I found it to be pretty well protected and safe.  Some small nuts can protect the move before the crux (where you clip a pin).

        I found the crux pitch to be easier than the dihedral. Knock off about 3 letter grades if you're tall.




        By  Andrew WellmanJan 1, 2001


        This route is [unbelievable]. It is [definitely] the best route I have climbed at Eldo. [Rossiter's] book gives it and "s" rating, and this can be interpreted as "a 15 foot traverse to the left, that if [your] pro pulled during a fall, or while trying to clip the pin, would [deposit] you [...10 feet up?] onto a ledge." This one gets an "s" for the same reason Rosy Crucifixion does, a fall at the beginning might be interesting. I just wanted to clarify this [because] you never know. If you have looked at this route all spring, like I have, and not gone up and done it yet, go for it, its not too dangerous. The airy positions are killer, too.




        By  David BensonMay 30, 2001


        The final pitch is most definitely NOT S. I place three good nuts before clipping the pin in the undercling. And thinking the S section might be coming later I sewed up the rest of the route.  I also believe the first pitch (10b) to be more technical than the last pitch (rated 10c). The last pitch is long and somewhat pumpy, but probably more like 10a/b than 10c.




        By  Anonymous CowardJul 23, 2001


        Linking these two pitches with the first three of X-M makes an excellent and airy route.  With three pitches at 10c and two at 10b, and four of them with s or vs grades, it makes for an aesthetic and rewarding line straight up the middle of the Bastille.




        By  Joe HugginsFrom: Grand JunctionOct 15, 2001


        I led the whole thing barefoot many years ago, does that mean I'm a real stud? Anyway, the picture actually shows the upper part of Wide Country to the right of the dihedral.




        By  Andrew KleinDec 31, 2001


        Be careful not to go up the thin crack on the first Outer Space pitch to get into the dihedral.  There is/was a ripped wired nut in this crack.  Stay right and do a blind traverse to get into the dihedral. The last pitch is airy, well-protected (small alliens, nuts) and perhaps even a little easier then other Eldo 10c's.




        By  Tony CappaMay 6, 2002


        This route is absolutely excellent.  I recommend it to anyone interested in getting some big air out under your feet.  I agree with everyone else's comments that the first pitch of Outer Space is tougher than the the second.  That dihedral is definitely more technical and devious than the one hard move to clip the pin in the undercling on the airy final pitch.  Also, I second that motion to go around toward the right on the mini-pillar from the belay atop the first pitch of the Bastille Crack instead of trying to go up and over it.  This is one of the best I've done so far (which isn't saying much but), launch yourself into Outer Space!  The cracks and huecos toward the very top are so fun!  Take care for rope drag as you are topping out.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 12, 2002


        Great route!  I too struggled with rope drag at the top of the last pitch even though I put long runners on everything below the roof.  When I got home I looked in my old Erickson guidebook and he splits the last pitch into two, adding a belay after the roof undercling and initial steep flake (40' off ledge.)  Next time I do the route I'll try it this way.




        By  Rich FarnhamSep 25, 2002


        A fantastic route!!  Definitely three stars!  As mentioned above, I could not see how it got an S rating.  The climb, and the crux, eats up stoppers.  Even the somewhat dubious looking fixed pin at the crux (pounded straight up into a slightly flaring crack) could be backed up with a large tcu, although I'm sure that pin has held its share of falls.  As for the short bulge that can be avoided on the first pitch, I would be curious to know whether it was on the original line of ascent or not.  It offers another short section of technical 5.10- moves, is well protected and fun, but can be easily avoided by climbing down and around it.  Booty/Fixed Gear Alert!  One of the stoppers just before the crux on the second (10c) pitch, was so good that my partner was unable to clean it.  He could get the nut to move in the crack, but couldn't get it out of the rock.  He said his last attempt to free it left it pointing upwards, but believed if a leader clipped a draw on it and tugged downwards, it would seat well into its original position.  I hope that it is removable or at least becomes a good fixed piece.  If someone posts that it is neither, I will go back up on a fixed line and see if I can get it out so that it doesn't detract from this classic line.

        Just climbed this line again (4th time) after 3 years away from it. For the "s" pitch I placed a pretty solid #4 BD stopper just before leaving the belay (while still standing on the ledge). After 2 moves I put in a PERFECT green Alien up and right a few feet from the stopper. 2 moves later there was a yellow alien placement staring me in the face in a left hand sidepull... then the #8 stopper to the left, then up to the TCU placement beside the pin and the pin. Then around the corner to tons of gear opportunity.  In short, the climb is not S at all, unless S stands for "S"ewn-up. As for the difficulty, I too find the dihedral pitch more technical than the upper pitch and would give both 10a/b. Staying low on the upper pitch is the key, reaching the undercling by the pin from below instead of traversing over to it.

        There's also a billion Lowe-ball placements if you've got 'em, like every route in Eldo.  There are precious few "real" runouts left in Eldo with modern gear.




        By  Lindsay GillJun 18, 2003


        I followed this climb for the 2nd time yesterday and was reminded of how beautiful the line truly is.  The 1st pitch has wonderful stemming and finger locks and a very spicy second pitch with great exposure!One of my favorite in the canyon.




        By  Jim CollinsOct 4, 2003


        GEAR beta: On the headwall pitch, bring a Yellow Camalot for the start of the traverse off the belay ledge. You can reach way up and right to plug in the yellow camalot before beginning the traverse section.  Also on the headwall pitch, bring lots (10 to 12) of extra runners to minimize rope drag.  Finally, be SURE to look down at the Bastille Crack as soon as you finish the opening traverse.  It looks like a sidewalk, and makes the whole adventure fun.

        I've heard that when this and a lot of other Eldo "S" routes were put up, Aliens and small nuts had not yet been invented, hence the rating.  I agree the crux of the 1st pitch felt harder than the second. Of course I lead P1 and got a ride on P2. For me, the crux on P2 was getting into the undercling, once you are there,pulling around the corner was no problem.  The pitch is definitely not over though with several 5.9 moves left but all well protected with good feet everywhere. Enjoy. Best route I've done in Eldo!!!

        Such a good route. Great after work elevetion gain. S rating is really pretty mild.

        I just thought I would throw out the suggestion to start with the Northcutt start and it makes for three great .10 pitches in a row.

        Stellar route! Followed 2 & 3 today and found it to be every bit as good as advertised.   On P2 the first hard move up and over the blocky prow is made easier using the overhead rail as the crack up and over peters out. This rail is slopey in the middle, but pretty good low and higher up...there is a fixed stopper at the top of the crack. The next hard move for me was out from under a pod like stance at the start of the dihedral below the pin, using bomber underclings and the crack out on the left face to begin the business of stemming.  This move is 10b and leads to sinker fingers above and good holds up high to the ramp.  Suppose if you don't like big exposure the start of P3 might scare you, but the holds are not too bad working up & over to the undercling crux move.  Mostly smearing for the feet here, there are a few small edges, and a pretty good jug around the corner to start the business on this pitch.  Pretty sustained  (9) moves, with lots of exposure, bring you to a tricky, somewhat greasy, (8+) move up and left past the last  pin.  Juggy huecos to the top ended my new favorite climb on the Bastille.

        I climbed this last night for the 3rd time and just wanted to add a more recent comment. Like everyone has said, what a great route.   p1 - Bastille Crack to ledge p2 - Chalked-up dihedral. There are three pins you can clip in this dihedral. 2 seemed bomber to me and the other one was decent. The hard part is getting situated in the dihedral. Once in the dihedral you can stem your way up using little hands. p3- Like everyone else has said, this is not run out at all. After pulling the 10c move, the upper part is pumpy and tricky. Counting the pin at the crux, there are three pins on this pitch as well. Only the last one looked like it belonged in the Eldo hall of fame.

        Such a sweet route! I don't consider myself a solid 10c climber and pulled this clean on lead after following it once. Not runout. If you are even close to the grade, Do This Route!




        By  TBlomNov 11, 2006


        Not 10c, not runout but very good and worth checking it out, maybe 10a/b.

        Alright, I have to admit to it and fess up.  I pulled the first piton thru the crux dihedral on the first pitch.  How one might ask?  I would love to tell a story of some great whip I took on this piton but actually, (sigh), I fell following this pitch mantling onto the sloping ledge off that horrible rail that looks great.  Yes, shameful I know.  I didn't play around with it, but I think you can get a small Alien where the piton once was.  Thanks to John for hauling me up this beauty and making it look casual.

        I climbed Outer Space again on 9/15.  I hadn't seen the above comment regarding the pin, so I was surprised when it wasn't there.  I was able to place a good nut AND a good yellow Alien within a foot of each other where the pin used to be, so I don't think it need to be replaced.  I will bring this up with the Eldo FHRC.




        By  SCherryFrom: San Diego, CASep 24, 2007


        Climbed this route in the afternoon on 9/23 for the 2nd time.  The pin is indeed missing from the start of the corner on the first pitch.  I was surprised to not find in there as I had remembered being able to clip it from the no-hands, shoulder-bar rest.  I am only 5'8" and was able to reach high and place a great wire to protect the crux move getting established in the corner.  No need to replace the pin in my opinion.




        By  Shawn MitchellFrom: BroomfieldAug 9, 2008


        Followed Shane Zentner today. Agree it's superb; agree the 1st pitch is trickier than the 2nd. But I think the 2nd still is the harder of the two and the crux was the marathon after the undercling/corner, which only felt about 10(a). The miles of 9+ pack a 10b/c pump factor, IMO. Good lead, Shane!  One other thought: On approach, it's not hard to stretch the  Bastille pitches across the traverse, past the little pillar, and belay directly under the dihedral. You can sling a couple flakes and get some small gear at the belay.

        I protected the opening moves of the last pitch with a red Metolius Astro nut, a green Alien, then clipped the pin. The remaining pitch was incredible and steep with multiple 5.9+ sections. There is a small, sloping ledge about half way through the pitch that offers a chance to 'rest', though I found it difficult to rest there.  The exposure, steepness, and awesome views of the canyon took my breath away.

        I climbed this today for the first time and have to agree with everyone that it is one of Eldo's best. I really don't climb S or R routes and the only reason I did was because of the comments here, so thanks everyone. I will agree the first pitch of Outer Space is the more difficult of the two. If I relate the dihedral to another classic, Over The Hill, the Outer Space dihedral is easier but still a handful and the exposure is no comparison. I am also comforted on OTH by all those pins...or is it discomforted on this one by the need to think a bit more. I'll chime a 10a.  Pitch 2 was relatively trivial, protects well, and is spectacular. I did not find a move harder than 5.9 on the pitch. With plenty of feet on the traverse and easy climbing around the corner I couldn't even tell where the crux was supposed to be. I thought it might have been a less secure leftward traverse near the end of the climb?  Overall, a fantastic climb with absolutely no R sections and plenty of rests if you want them.

        The pin protecting the chimney section at the beginning of the final dihedral on P1 is gone (or at least I could've sworn it was there before). You can get in a #4 BD nut and a pink tricam (neither of which felt bomber) before taking off. Fortunately, you can get gear soon after.  The high traverse on P1 is significantly harder than going low and contains the (5.10c) crux move of the whole climb IMHO.




        By  Andy LaakmannSite LandlordFrom: Bend, ORMay 20, 2009 rating:  5.10b 6a+ 19 VII- 19 E2 5b$(function(){$('#stars_1285423538').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        A wonderful route as advertised.  It protects *very* well.... and most definitely does NOT warrant an R rating.  You can place gear anywhere you want it (perhaps with the exception of the last 30 feet up the huecos on P2, but the climbing is easy).  I thought P1 contained the crux, and the stemming felt about 10a/b (and a touch easier than Over The Hill).  If there was a pin at the base of the stemming (in the chimney like alcove), it is gone now.... but a red alien fit nicely.  The P2 "crux" felt about 10a as well, but the entire second pitch is definitely a journey. I placed the EXACT gear Tony B lists above, and they are all bomber.  There are plenty of rests up the final headwall, but the various moves are engaging and sometimes a bit tricky.  I had pretty bad rope drag, despite judicious use of slings, so I'm not sure how I could have avoided it.  The pitch is spectacular, but the rope drag is a big bummer.  A standard rack (nuts and two sets of cams from tiny to #3 camalot) is fine.  Lots of slings.    Edit: I just looked at a photo and saw one of someone belaying under the "end" of the traverse, and that looks like the ticket to avoiding rope drag. My belay was towards the beginning of the traverse.  YMMV

        I agree with Tony both that the top and bottom pitches are about equivalent in difficulty, and that the gear placements do not warrant an S rating.  I will say however that the gear on the P2 traverse is strenuous to place.  I was only able to get a small nut and a yellow tcu before clipping the pin and giving it a go around the corner.  Once I got around the corner, I was expecting the climb to let up a bit, but a number of 5.9 moves awaited me before I found a substantial rest stance.  Great climb!

        Definitely in Eldo's Top 10, no top five routes.  Everything about it is great!  Great gear, great positioning, vertical, comfortable belay ledges, exposure, and so on....

        This route is junk.  My partner and I did it this past weekend in near-freezing temps wearing shoes that Chinese-foot-binding specialists would have deemed torturous;  we went without water, food, or warm clothing.  To say it went easily would be an understatement, but frankly, a couple times my feet were so cold I could have sworn my name was Hugh Herr.  All the beta is total crap.  There is no exposure . . . no pumpy headwall . . . no airy traverse.  There was some rather lackluster graffiti we noticed (LK who?), which I took the time to chip off and replace with a nice (and obviously more gratifying) "Eat Me" in bright orange spray paint.  I always huff the orange stuff on routes.  It just gets me there faster . . . .




        By  Mitch MusciFrom: Estes Park, COJun 8, 2011


        For the P2 crux, there's no need to undercling high by the pin. Just stay lower on better hand holds.

        Believe the hype.  It's all true.   I thought the undercling move was money.   Lots of gear at the crux.

        CLASSIC! I have wanted to do this route since I moved to CO a couple of years ago. However, that R rating like many others has scared me away. This route definitely does not need an R rating. You can, and I did, staple the route up, hahaha! This fact does not take away from the exposure. The last pitch is amazingly exposed and awesome. I feel like the crux is short, but there is still some great moves to come to finish the route. I can't wait to run up this again, and I am psyched for anyone who has been scared off this thing to give it a shot. Great climbing.




        By  Alan DoakFrom: boulder, coAug 12, 2013


        It sounds like I was off-route on pitch one. I followed the chalk into the first corner with the ripped nut. I moved out onto the left face of the corner, using the thin finger rail, before crossing back right. It went, but it was harder than 9+, and I was a bit above my last piece by the time I was on top of the block. I'd be curious to hear what people rate it.

        Spectacular position and interesting climbing.  The first pitch is insecure and sustained at 10a for a good 20-30 feet.  I think the traditional "S" rating comes from this pitch, as you have to climb 8-10 feet above a small wired nut and risk a ledgefall.  I followed both pitches, so take this in context, but to me the second pitch does seem to protect surprisingly well.

        Wonderful route!  I didn't find it R, maybe PG-13 going around the first bulge P1 traversing to the corner, and on the P2 upper hueco-ed runout to the top, but neither sections are near the crux 5.10b-ish grade. Pro seemed plentiful and solid otherwise.  Don't let your guard down after pulling through the P2 crux. It stays pretty continuous and has a couple more interesting cruxy bits on the upper headwall.

        This route deserves all the hype it gets. First time up, we brought a single rack thinking it would be casual 5.10, and I used all my finger-sized cams early on the first pitch... made the crux dihedral very exciting climbing 15 feet above a small wire. The first time I ever got on this thing I ripped what my partner said was a super old and crucial RP fixed in the middle of the first crux of the first pitch. Sorry! First moves at the beginning of the second pitch are classic Eldo: if you do it right, it is laughably easy and if you do it wrong it is insecure and weirdly strenuous. Good on you if you can remember all of the beta from memory on the second pitch every time! I invariably have to climb up and down and up and down a couple times remembering the perfect way to do the several tricky sections of that final second pitch. Substitute Wide Country for the Bastille approach pitch with a bizarre intermediate leftward hand traverse in between (R-ish) for full value!

        Third pitch is basically a sport climb. Fixed pins abound! Only placed a red C3 on the traverse and a couple finger-sized pieces on some of the 5.9 sections before the juggy face. Great climbing nonetheless!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb.    The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon.  As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, "avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."  Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right.  The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it.  P1. 5.7, 60'.  Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains.  You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch.  P2. 5.6, 90'.  Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face.  Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall.  Belay at a crack with a fixed pin.  If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance.  Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8.  Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line.  P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope.  P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux).  Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge.  A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor.  P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin.  Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux).  Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner.  Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.  Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.  P5.  Several options here:  a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'.  Climb the chimney to the top.  b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.  c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'.  Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation.  To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and  then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff.   (Ed. Note: beginner leaders--make sure you're solid on crack techique before trying this one. Placing gear is not trivial for the inexperienced.)Protection Standard rack to #3 Camalot.    Bring a #4 Camalot if you want to do the 5.8 variation on the second pitch, or if you want to belay just above the roof on the 5.8 variation on the last pitch.

        A Black Diamond OZ quickdraw was dropped on the 4th pitch and is probably laying near the belay station. Had to get my friend to the airport, so we weren't able to lower down to retrieve it. If you find it, please hit me up beer and/or good climbing karma will be rewarded! jdrich79@yahoo.com

        Note that it is possible to combine the first 3 pitches with a 60m rope, and one can combine the last 2 pitches even with a 50m rope (but watch out for rope drag).




        By  Matt BaumanJan 1, 2001


        I agree with George (by the way, your site is one of my faves George), the slick beginning of the crack seemed harder than 5.7 (Id say 7+). Also, a GREAT variation to the final pitch (avoiding the easy chimney) is to step right and head for the HUGE left facing dihedral with a wide crack....climb wide crack for ~10 feet and then take finger crack that angles up and left, becomes straight up and then opens to hands as it angles back right to the top of the dihedral.....GREAT 5.8 finish to this classic climb.




        By  T. MainoFrom: Denver, COJan 1, 2001


        Best 5.7 around. It seems 5.7 to me... but then I've done it about 100 times. Great tip on the variation up top... thanks.




        By  Derek LawrenceFrom: BaileyJan 1, 2001


        This route was originally rated 5.6 in the old Ament guide. I won't say it's that easy but if you stem between the crack and the edge of the flake to the right and than cross left at the top it's much easier than 5.8. Done this way the crux actually seems to be 3rd short pitch.




        By  Chris FisherJun 13, 2001


        I agree with the 5.7 rating.  The only way I could see the first pitch being 5.8 is if you don't have a long reach. Those of us 6 foot or better do have an advantage. I've done it several times as it is one of my favorites.  I also agree with the third pitch around the double cracks being more difficult than the first pitch, but only for a few moves.




        By  Paul GiglioJul 28, 2001


        If you think wider is better, try doing the "move left down the ledge and go up a corner system" pitch one pitch too soon (where you're clearly supposed to do the finger crack).  You'll soon find yourself in a short awkward flared chimney with a piton near the top that exits onto the ledge just below the normal P4 anchor.  Probably 7+ or 8 compared with some of the chimneys at Lumpy.




        By  Casey BernalFrom: Arvada, COOct 24, 2001 rating:  5.7+ 5a 15 V+ 13 MVS 4b$(function(){$('#stars_1938250969').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Casey Bernal - Although it should be obvious, I thought it must be said here too. Most of the guidebooks state explicitly to place pro in the flake and crack in P1 before stepping into them. There have been several ground falls here. This is one of the most spectacular 5.7 climbs around. Enjoy.




        By  Michael KomarnitskyFounding FatherFrom: Seattle, WAOct 24, 2001


        On the photo, the short traverse out right on P2 I believe is 5.8, though I could be wrong - when I've done the route, I've continued up and slightly left following easy climbing instead of going right around that flake.




        By  Hayden YurkanisNov 6, 2001


        Alright, I will put my two cents in on the rating---5.7. In my HUMBLE opinion, it isn't 5.8 or 7+.  Also I didn't find it to be that slick and the feet were solid. cheers




        By  Casey BernalFrom: Arvada, COJun 10, 2002 rating:  5.7+ 5a 15 V+ 13 MVS 4b$(function(){$('#stars_980500206').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        This is a good place to sit in the shade and watch all the beginner epics. "well protected 5.7+ crack - I can do that - I once led a 5.9 in the gym with no falls". In case there is not enough amusement with the Bastille Crack you can also watch the antics on Werk Supp. Apparently, this is a good place to toprope (either the Bastille, Northcutt, Werk Supp, March of Dimes, etc) because it seems everyday someone is blocking the upper pitches with a beginner toprope session.  While you might find this amusing to watch be sure to stand back because at least one gumby will drop something or pull on a loose rock. It can even be exciting (or horrifying) to watch as the beginners sketch out because the crack is different (ie Eldo-type) then the one they practiced placing pro in and they place nothing that will stay put or hold a big fall. I guess it is easier to make enough money to buy a rack then to learn how to use any of it safely. eek. Somehow it makes me feel better and more relaxed to watch people on the NW Corner, Hair City, Outer Space, even Jules Verne. At least they know what they are doing. CB




        By  Anonymous CowardJul 11, 2002


        I must have screwed up.  There was an early move on that first pitch that felt tougher than the first pitch at George's Tree in Lumpy (5.9).  The rest of it was more like 5.7, just an awesome route.




        By  Kevin CurriganFrom: LakewoodJul 20, 2002


        At the top of P3 on the left side there is a tiny, right facing dihedral.  The plate/flake perpendicular to this on the face is loose.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoAug 8, 2002


        Led the route today and felt P1 to be solid (7) with one polished hold on the crack. Maybe a half grade higher because its a little slippery. But what difference does it make, splitting hairs over a (7) climb? Definitely test your mettle on P2 and take the flake to the right (8) before the belay ledge (lay it back and smear). On the last pitch read Matt Bauman's description above and go for it.  That way is the right way, for the Bastille finale, in my opinion.




        By  Kevin CurriganFrom: LakewoodSep 12, 2002


        The variation at the top of pitch two is definitely the way to go for if you're up for it.  Its easier than Reggae only in that it is shorter.  Technically it feels about the same as it has the layback thing going at 5.8.  It protects at the bottom of the flake with a big cam; #9 Metolius.




        By  SteveSep 21, 2002


        First, this is a frickin' damn good climb.  Second, I think that there are many reasons that warrant giving this route a 5.7 c/d S (V) grade, although it can be done 5.6 C1.  The traverse to gain the crack on the first pitch is frickin' hard: the crux move requires technical stemming and finger locking and the feet have been super-greasy ever since some ignoramus decided to use some old motor oil instead of chalk to "tic" the holds.  There is also groundfall potential because you must wait till you gain the crack to place gear lest the throngs of watching climbers and gapers will think that you are a miserable coward that barely deserves to slave away at belaying a sportie at Table Mountain let alone climb THE Bastille Crack.  I'd recommend a stick clip to pre-place gear in the crack in case you get gripped up there.  After that, its pretty much a cake walk unless you get your haul bag stuck.  If this happens or another party slows you down, the ledge at P3 is a good place to bivy.  After completing the climb, a tricky 3.9 sportaneering gully with difficult route-finding must be descended in order to get back to your car.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoSep 27, 2002


        While passing this route on our way to the upper west side of the Bastille recently I spotted a young woman really struggling to work out the beginning of the crack.  I noticed her leader had combined P1 & P2.  I'd be curious how this situation worked out.  I suggest when leading this route, and combining 1 & 2 or any long routes close to the stream, especially with inexperienced climbers, bring 2-way radios.  Otherwise, you'll be sitting up on that ledge waiting and waiting, unable to hear or see your partner, until finally forced into an assumption which can lead to an accident. Be careful out there!




        By  Anonymous CowardSep 27, 2002


        Hey Ernie, I was on the crack today with my girlfriend and I strung P1 and P2 together. As far as the climbing when it was nice not to have to stop. There was some confusion with the who was on belay etc. As soon as she got up to me, we figured out a system of tugs etc so there wouldn't be any accidents. I have never climbed The Bastille before and I love it! I wasn't real sure how the walkie-talkies would have worked out so I left them at home...Yeah I'll know better next time....Oh yes, there will be a next time!




        By  Anonymous CowardDec 12, 2002


        Bottom felt like a greasy 5.8.  I thought it was equal to Reggae.

        According to "Best of Boulder", this route is now 5.8+!  According to "Accidents in North American Mountaineering 2002", this route is named "Bestowal Crack".  Just shows you can't believe everything you read ... and a good editor is hard to find ...

        Current speed records on the Bastille North Face are: July 1998 ground to top of climb  5 minutes 33 seconds ground to summit of crag (above YOUR MOTHER)  6 minutes 59 seconds  P.S. It will never gain in popularity, but climbing down the BASTILLE CRACK is excellent.  It's 5.7, the same as an ascent of the route.




        By  Bruce BerkowitzJul 18, 2003


        Great climb.I dunno, maybe I lucked onto the right sequence, but i thought the first pitch was not the crux. I agree with those that though that the 3rd pitch was the hardest. More committing, at any rate.  Still a classic any way you slice it.




        By  TBDJul 21, 2003


        Instead of the normal 5.4 chimney section of the last pitch (about 1/2 way, after gaining the huge sloping ledge), consider the next giant dihedral to right.  It offers an offwidth and some crack/face climbing.  It goes at 5.7 and is more consistent with the grade for the previous 3 pitches.  Also, more fun in my opinion.




        By  Chris MuellerJul 28, 2003 rating:  5.7 5a 15 V+ 13 MVS 4b$(function(){$('#stars_225387039').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        This climb is great.  Easily the best 5.7 around.  As for the rating, it compares nicely to The Owl (Dome), Empor (Cob Rock), and Verschnidung (West Ridge), all 5.7 crack climbs.




        By  Rich AschertFeb 1, 2004


        Just FYI, the 1967 guide rates the Bastille 5.6, Calypso 5.5, Tagger 5.8, Vertigo 5.10, Ruper 5.7, Grand Giraffe 5.8, T2 5.9 etc.etc. I guess 5.6 isn't what it used to be.




        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COFeb 3, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_779380471').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        If this climb were rated solely for "maximum ego improvement" it would be 5.12 by now!  Sometimes the difficulty of a climb CAN change over time.  Holds may break off, or become slick with repeated use.  I'm not sure if this has occurred on this particular climb (I didn't climb it in the 60s or 70s) but it's something to consider.  I don't believe the individual rating of a climb is important except as compared to other climbs.

        The climb has gotten harder, at least since I moved here in 1995- slicker, more polished, etc.  So I don't know how it was in 1960 or whatever, but I guess I expect some upgrading. For what it's worth, I'd give it 5.7 right now. As I recall, the rating was boosted to keep tentative leaders at the 'real 5.7 grade' away because they kept falling off of the start, which was not protected well by most 5.7 leaders cruxing there. Other climbs, such as Grand Giraffe have seen similar action. I've done it maybe 4X, once every few years since 1995 and each time it seems slicker than the last.  Once it starts getting slick, people start slipping more, and the slippery slope of schmarm speeds along. Grand Giraffe is harder than it was.  10a is fair.  Plus, 10a is usually easier than 9+ anyway. As for T2, you all know that the starting flake fell off right?  That the past crux hold does not exist, and that the ground below has eroded?  Now I'm not an old guy, and I 'never was' so calling me 'washed-up' or a 'has been' is quite a stretch. SO I guess I'll be considered objective here?  Nah- I'll get labeled something or another by whoever, according the their agenda. So here's my take on it. I agree that in many cases the grades got softer. Some of this because certain climbs got much easier with the advent of sticky rubber, and others because of gear/protection options. Maybe when the average 5.9 got easier, but a good solid crack climb, (were rubber and pro are not relevant did not change), the grade on that moved by comparison and got 'harder.'  Maybe only 20% of all routes really changed, so the system moved to upgrade 20% not downgrade 80%? Maybe that's why I can climb hard cracks but thin face hurts me?  As for grades on other routes, particularly 'modern' or 'new wave' free climbing grades. I suspect there is some element of ego from previous sandbaggers and current mercy-graders.  I'm certainly not feeling any stronger than 10 years ago, but seem to climb more hard routes despite somewhat frail health.  So what can I say?  The times change and I'm still having fun.  That sums it up.

        Climbed the Bastille Crack for the first time yesterday afternoon.  I've climbed at Eldorado for several years now and have finally gotten the chance to climb Bastille Crack (there is always a line at the base of it).   Polished, dirty, lots of lost gear, pigeon crap, and usually a line of people on it. The canyon is much too big to wait for this route to open up.

        Climbed it this weekend and got to lead the whole thing b/c my partner had already led it a few times.  I think it's a stellar climb.  I'm a 5.7/5.8 leader and found it challenging.  Tricky moves throughout.  Started at about 9 am.  Nobody waiting at the bottom, and pretty much had the climb to ourselves.  The infamous slippery P1 wasn't slippery, and the pro was just fine.  Still probably a good idea to be very cautious at the bottom of the P1 crack b/c a fall from there could be bad.  Really bad if your pro pulls.  I didn't find a slippery section on the whole climb.  I think because the rock was still cool (no sweaty hands) and the route hadn't had any traffic yet that day.  Tried the 5.8 variation at the top of P2 but didn't quite get it.  Couldn't turn the corner from the lower traverse to the right-facing side of the flake.  Seemed like the only way to do it was to pull a big lieback, but I was too pumped by the time I tried that, and ended up falling and heading up the standard route.  Can anybody offer some beta on this move?  Cool route everyone.  A must do.

        I climbed the Bastille with my 5 year old son last week and it was great. When climbing with little kids (if anyone other than me does?) the hard part is actually the 5.4 part of the climb because of the reach. I had to push his bum up a couple of the rocks meanwhile I could not keep up to him on P2.  Fun climb but a crack climb. Kids might do better on the Werk Supp route, I will let you know later this week!

        THE classic. The queues don't form for the access reason alone. Consider that many only do P1 but this designation is for the entire route. On the rating, the old 5.6 was before a general consensus. The 5.8 rating (Rossiter, 1989) was before it became ultra-polished. It was down-graded to .7 but after a many-year hiatus I am astonished at how polished a route can become and believe a return to .8 is justified for the hardest move on P1 with the variation on P2 being 8-. Expect more Eldo routes to show similar signs of wear.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 12, 2004


        The Ernie Port photo shows the step across from the flake to the crack on P1 for those curious about the part that became greasier after the 80s. Newer leaders, be sure you slot this crack before committing but don't immediately slot a backup higher above you, IMO - you might need the room and the crux goes rather quickly; this has been the scene of far too many accidents.

        Let's remember that at one point in time, there was no such thing as a 5.11.  This used to be a .6 out of a possible .10.  It now gets a 5.7 rating because we all love Eldorado and it's own personal stiff rating system.  Sure I'll lead .11d at sport park.  But I'm still shut down above .10a at Eldo.  That's just the way the cookie crumbles.   We are using the "Yosemite decimal system".  Try leading the first pitch of "After Six" in Yosemite Valley.  This pitch used to be considered 5.6, and it now gets the 5.7 rating.  This Pitch is also WAY harder and more sustained than anything on Bastile.  Make sure to use an extra long sling at the starting flake,  I had a cam walk all the way up and out of my ownership.Having at least three 1"+/- pieces extra at the main ledge before p4 makes the anchor simpler.  There are several bomber placements in this range at this belay.  A 50m rope will get you to the top from here if you watch the rope drag(long slings).All things aside, I love this route.  A great way to shake off the cobwebs after winter.

        Robert Curtis - I did this last thursday after climbing the first pitch of Touch and Go (8+), honestly I think between a hard 5.7 to a solid 5.8 is fair (for the first pitch).  Lots of fun!

        I climbed the Bastille Crack again last weekend with my buddy Rob, who taught me to climb 22 years ago. We were the second party on Saturday morning. The first party was from Illinois, and they were great guys enjoying a week in the Rockies. At the bottom of the third pitch, the belayer offered to wait and let us pass on the fourth pitch, because we were climbing a bit faster than them. We took him up on the offer, I gave them a little beta on avoiding rope drag on the last pitch, and climbed quickly. A beautiful day, a classic climb, friendly climbers. Wouldn't it be great if we could all treat each other like these guys treated us?




        By  Michael KullmanAug 12, 2004


        I think the crux on the first pitch might be 8ish if you are short, definitely 7ish if you are taller (like me).

        Did this one last Saturday.  I'd say P1 goes at 5.8 due to the glassy like finish on the rock.  Also, I recommend the 5.8 variation on the last pitch.  I'm guessing a red Alien would have fit nicely at the crux (last move of the climb), which of course I didn't have because it disconnected from me somehow while I was fiddling with gear.  Thus, Larry's red Alien took a ground fall.  RIP red Alien, you were badly missed :( .  The green Alien I used was just barely cammed.  At the crux, just remember you have good feet, just keep moving them up!

        Hi guys, I'm sure I'm not as good a climber as most of you are, but I just redid the Bastille Crack a day before Bastille day, and I couldn't disagree more with your comments.  I first did it in June of 1975, and have done it a few times since.  It still seemed no harder than a 5.6 to me, maybe minimal 5.7.  The first pitch isn't any greasier than I remember it .  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  It is a great climb, but it's not that hard.

        I did this 1st time last week; I would simply second most of the comments here. It wasn't difficult, I thought the 1st pitch was EZ, everyone says it is the crux. 2nd and 3rd pitches tripped me up a little. AWESOME climb! What is this talk of greasy 1st pitch? I had no problem and I don't even use chalk.  colorado-hiking.net/bastille1....

        Lots of gear on 4th pitch!  My partner and I got into a jam last night when we ran out of light and had foolishly left our headlamps at home.  Because of this, our cleaning of the 4th pitch was hurried and whoever is the first to climb it today (Saturday, October 8th) will find some decent pieces.  Of that person wishes to trade those piece for some tasty beer and good karma, please call Ryan @ 303.746.5643 and I will happily pick them up.  Also, the days are getting shorter so don't forget your headlamps, even if you leave the house in the early afternoon, by the time you wait for a couple of parties and get going, it gets dark fast.  Thanks again to the guys who were kind enough to lower us a headlamp from the top (we had made it to within 50 feet of the summit when I decided not to break an ankle trying to lead out in pitch darkness).  Thanks!  Oh yeah, great route of course, I thought the crux was the 3rd pitch and that is is 5.7, but it's old school Eldo 5.7 for sure.




        By  Anonymous CowardNov 1, 2005


        There is no way the first pitch is 5.8. I would rate it at a 5.7-, but it was pretty wet when I climbed it. I can see how if you climb it wrong it could be harder. It is a step from a big stance at the bottom of the flake, to good feet and nice holds.  Pitch 3 is the crux and went at easy 5.7, it is really short with big holds all over and really good gear whenever you want.   I took 1 set of cams to #2 Camalot w/ doubles in green, yellow and red Aliens, and about 5 stoppers. I  wish I would have had a lot of big stoppers, some hexs and 1 set of cams from green Alien to #1 Camalot. It would be fun to climb this with just nuts and hexs and I'm definitely going to do that next time.  A fun route and a must do, I can see why it gets so much traffic.




        By  Jeff JohnsonFrom: Folsom, CAJun 7, 2006


        This crack is probably by far one of the most exciting and thrilling in all of Eldorado Canyon.  5.7+ is a good rating, a standard rack with plenty of cams will do you just fine.  The first ten feet or so of the second pitch has a small roof and can be somewhat tricky if you don't have much experience with roofs.  But overall very good climb and worth climbing.

        After never wanting to wait in line, I decided to send this route on Sat. morning.  Got to the base about 6:45 and no one was on the Bastille, yet.  Found the route to not nearly as slick as I thought it would be and 5.7 a very fair rating.  I think most of the route is 5.6 with a couple 5.7 moves on P1 and P3.  Pro placement is not trivial on the first pitch, but it's all there, if you seek it out.  Classic, one not to be missed.

        The third pitch is perhaps the best 5.7 pitch I've done anywhere.  Simply amazing movement, location, and protection.  Also, the 4th pitch is very easy to get confused on the proper route.  Check the topo before you leave the ground.

        Led the first pitch again yesterday after doing a number of 8's recently  in Eldo and at JTree, and no way is the first pitch 5.8 - at least not for a 6' male with a -1/2" ape index.  5.7 definitely feels right - but your crack technique and gear placing skills must be solid.  I'm also not sure why folks get confused about the 4th pitch.  To me, there's only one place to climb that looks anything like the published grade of the pitch (5.6).  Everything else anywhere nearby looks MUCH harder.  OTOH, I find the description above of this pitch to be confusing and not matching the pitch well.  Just move slightly down-ramp from the belay and climb up in the easiest spot and follow the easiest climbing.  It's really pretty obvious (of course, maybe I'm just not a good enough climber and so am not tempted by the other possibilities! ;^)

        Finally, found the time to get out and do this one.  My wife and I were in boulder for our 10th wedding anniversary, so her gift to me was following me on the Bastille.  What an incredible climb. Pitch #3 was definitely my favorite, with great position and gear.  I did the traditional finish up the chimney, and finished that by moving left from the top of the chimney up about 8-10 feet of slightly overhanging pocketed face.  It was a fun, bouldery, but very short add on, that reminded me of Hueco Tanks.

        No wonder this route always has a line, THE BEST 5.7 EVER!  Can easily be done in 2 longer pitches without much rope drag if you have fairly good rope management skills.  Climb past the first pitch and then past the start of Out Space then up to the Traverse at the top of the in cut ramp.  Belay before doing the Traverse.  From there, lead to the top.  Have Fun!

        I'm not quite 6', I'm a much better face climber than crack climber, and I made the traverse from the flake on P1 pretty early. That said... I would rate it an 8. Maybe I did it wrong, because the crux on P3 I felt to be easier than the crux on P1. Awesome climb though.

        There is a very loose flake right below the second belay. It makes for a great left foot when heading for the belay ledge, but when I stepped on it it flexed about half an inch. I was suprised that it didn't break off. Fortunately there are plenty of other options to use and the climbing is very easy in that section. Have fun on this route and be careful. Peace.

        Hmmm.  I was a bit disappointed. Rewritten is a way better 5.7. I last climbed the Crack back in '78 (Litz are you out there?). Amazing what cam technology can do to your adrenaline rush. By the way, does anyone in Boulder have a job? By 9:30 on a Tuesday morning, Eldo is teeming with people top roping on the Bastille.  What the hey?

Great climbing, and check out the cable that Ivy Baldwin used to tightrope over to the Wind Tower.  If you liked this route, try the Lover's Leap Crack off 470 and 85. It's got the same exposure and a 'two move stem crux'.

        I climbed the first pitch of this last September.  My second lead at 5.7, and yeah, the step below the crack is slippery, but if you reach into the crack, there's a tiny ledge of rock inside the crack on the side that you're stepping from that you can wrap your fingertips around and get a pretty solid grip (or was I dreaming).  I had to feel around in the crack for a bit to find it.  It was a lot of fun, and just the first pitch deserves classic status for being as vertical as it is at the grade, and the rock is beautiful.  Clouds rolled in and it was raining as we rapped down from the first belay.    Re: the grade...I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I don't see people trying to upgrade Friday's Folly, which I led the day before, and found much more difficult, at least in the problem-solving and psychological aspects of it.  For one, the moves on the first pitch of the Bastille Crack were obvious, no guessing, and if you have trouble placing adequate gear here (how?!) you should work your way up to the grade more slowly.  It was easy to protect, even for a beginner like me.  Having to watch out for cars while you belay is a little odd....




        By  flynnJan 11, 2010


        Re the fourth pitch: when in doubt, go up and left. When you can't see around a corner, reach, and your hand will land on a 5.6 hold. If it looks harder than 5.6, don't go there. If it feels harder than 5.6, you're off route. Remember up and left.




        By  Gary SchmidtFrom: Boulder, COFeb 1, 2010


        Yes, and per Chris' comment above about belaying the road, I actually threw my rope down on the road while rappelling down off of Werk Supp and a car came and drove right over it! Didn't even bother to try and go around.

        Did this climb today for the first time, and it was great.  I did the 8 variation on the 2nd pitch and didn't have any big cams but was able to slot a nut up and left from the start of the short traverse.  The variation was not to difficult, but it did feel a little run out.    It had rained last night, but the route looked dry. The 4th pitch felt like 5.8s though as half the holds had water on them and couldn't be used, be careful if it's wet.

        A friend and I did Bastille Crack a few weeks ago.  I have a question about the final pitch variations.  I the new (awesome) Eldo Guide book it lists an 8- PG variation that climbs the corner off-width and it lists an 8+ PG-13 variation that takes the nice crack just to the left of the off-width.  We did the "8- PG" variation which approximately matches the "fun finish" listed above, and found the gear by the crux to be a little lacking.  Maybe a #5 would protect the last few moves up the off-width, but with a standard rack you find yourself about 10 feet above your last piece(s) and only 16 feet above a ledge.  I haven't done the crack to the left, but I have a hard time imagining how the gear could be worse given that it's a finger/hand crack.  Any thoughts?

        This was one of my first leads and a great climb.  And the low crux getting into the hand crack I was told to protect before commiting to the hand crack.  Which is done easily and you don't have to worry about your gear ripping out of that sketchy flake.

        Call me silly, but I found P2 to be a good deal harder than P1. P1 was scarier until you've protected after the step-across, but otherwise, I wonder how P2 gets a lower rating? Superb climb and excellent for every foot of it to the top of the last pitch!  In addition too, linking P1 & P2, with 70m doubles we easily linked P3 & P4. It could possibly work with a 60m single if you are smart with your pro placements on the first part of P4 and don't mind running that part out.  BTW, my 5.8 rating is just in relation to how the climb felt to me compared to ratings in Yosemite Valley. Eldo's ratings are stout :-)

        There did not seem to be any moves that warrant 5.7. I submitted a 5.4 rating because it seemed easier than any other 5.5-6 multi-pitch routes I have done. The short third pitch was definitely the funnest climbing of the entire route.

        Tyrel, quit trolling. Even by Seneca standards, these were worth their ratings, not to mention I either went off route or pitch 4 is definitely the crux pitch! Not the start.

        Pitch 4 did have that funky stance on it, but I don't think it's 5.7. I have sweated bullets on 5.6 pitches in the Gunks, and this route was CHILL. If this is 5.8, then I should be one-hanging Jumbo Love.

        Tyler, the first three pitches are way harder than 5.4. If you think The Wind Ridge (5.5) is harder than the Bastille, you are crazy. Calling this climb 5.4 goes well beyond sandbagging, it's being a jerk.

        Toomy, I am simply voicing my opinion on the grade along with 50 other people, so why don't you forget the attitude and leave it alone. It is such a problem that I have an opinion that is different than a few others?

        The transfer at the first crack can easily be protected with a 0.5 if you can reach across to the crack.  I placed this before I fully committed and was way fine.    Overall, fun route, I'd give it 5.7. Did it this morning at 8 and while cold, we had the whole wall to ourselves (no wonder....no sun haha).  Glad I woke up to do this.

        After many years of not doing this route and just walking by... Plan B ended up with us on this route while rock trumbling was going on at Redgarden!  Personally found it to be anti-climactic!  Pitch 2 was great! Combining 1 & 2 would be a great pitch and maybe 1, 2, and 3 with a 70m would be stellar! 4 and 5 were just not interesting, blocky, and slightly wandering ... feel these 2 pitches take away from it being classic!  Atop pitch 3 is a fixed cam a #1 & 2 maybe a 3 cam should help that belay also a stopper, too. Atop pitch 2 with a pin gear about 1 to 2 inches... I used a lrg stopper and tricam.... Extend those runners to not sacrifice your cams... so many cams walked deep into the flake systems.... Leave the small stuff behind... and the big stuff, too, 1/2" to 3" place non stop, so double up on those if you like placing pro very 8-10 ft. and personally think of this climb as G rated!  Superfun, though don't get me wrong... will do again for sure... enjoyed the historic pin scars, and blown & cracked pins on this route... good reminder to back them up or just skip and place pro!

        Does anyone know what the grade is for doing the more direct line for pitch 4 (according to the pitch breakdown in the description).  I didn't traverse all the way over to the handcrack/gully and instead took the first line up that I could (shallow, corner-type thing that turned into face climbing past some shrubberies).  The grade felt in line with the previous pitches, and besides being a little dirty/loose, it was fun.

        A gear graveyard!  Even with long slings I had a couple pieces try and walk on me, so watch out. Do the 5.8 "fun finish"!

        Climbed this route again yesterday for the 5th or 6th time and finished right before a wicked storm rolled in. Had what I would guess to be 70+ mph winds for the hike down. Super fun! Has anyone done it in 2 pitches with a 70m? I was thinking you could link pitches 1-3 (the best climbing), and 4/5 with some long slings for the traverse on pitch 4.   It's also quite easy to link 3/4 with a 60m, I thought about attempting pitches 3-5 yesterday, but we had a 60m rope and I think I would have came up about 20' short and had some bad rope drag.

        I've done it in two pitches with a 70m a few times. I linked 1+2, 3+4+5.

        Cool, next time I try it, I think I'm going to shoot for 1-3 and 4/5.

        Linking pitches 1-3 and 4-5 is possible with a 70m, there is even rope to spare.  Drag is really not bad, even with 200 ft of rope out.

        Did it in 2 pitches yesterday morning with a 60m.  Single rack to 4.  If this is your first trad or trying to break into 5.7/5.8, the crack will SEW up with doubles from fingers to 4.  No needs for nuts.  0.3 protects off the deck very nicely.  If you're comfortable running it out, 2 pitches is the way to go.

        Climbed this beautiful multipitch with my wife yesterday. Super uber polished in areas and def seems like it can be pretty crowded, but we were lucky and had it to ourselves. It is ridiculous how much pro has been left behind in this route. Lastly, the shade is awesome!

        Loved to solo this at sunset, but it's harder than 5.7 sandbagger rating back in the day. When you're 30 feet off the deck and you realize that you committed yourself to this free climb, you're focused like a fiend. Didn't want to start "The Elvis" and peel off. Much relief at the summit by the old cables with the orange sunset. A memory etched in my mind forever. Felt a rush of adrenaline in my veins after that climb that got me hooked on climbing for life.

        Doesn't get any better for a classic climb (unless you are moonlighting on a birthday climb with your best friends in tandem, and then it's simply CLASSIC).

        Pitch 4/5 can be a bit confusing if you don't check out topo a ahead of time, mistakenly got off route and had to back track to get back onto route. Accidentally left a yellow Neutrino in a piton on pitch 5! There for the taking!

        Climbed Bastille Crack and Rewritten the weekend of 8/15/15. In our humble opinion, Rewritten is a grade harder than Bastille Crack. So 5.6/5.7 or 5.7/5.8, take your pick. Personally have Bastille Crack at 5.7 and Rewritten at 5.8.   Most of this route is protected from the sun which is nice. P1 is pretty polished. P1 & P2 are the crux pitches goes easy after that. The downclimb from the summit is pretty cool.  Bastille Crack and Rewritten are awesome climbs!

        Accidentally left a tied sling on the barrier wall opposite the Bastille Crack today. Blue with a black covering the neck.  If someone picked it up, please contact me...it isn't very valuable but has sentimental value...it was given to me by a dear friend.  Thanks.

        Super fun route. The last time I climbed it around 15 years ago I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have, since it started pouring rain on the 4th pitch, and we topped out with lightning snapping all around. A much more pleasant day today.

        Anybody have the backstory on the exploded pin on P4? As I wandered by it, I got lost in a daydream of someone blowing it out as they whipped by holding a loose block, although I suspect something more mundane, like someone trying to remove it via funkness. It would make for a nasty landing if that was your first and only pro and you fell.

        I thought 5.7 was fair, although I'm from the Midwest, so I'm used to stiff grades. The first pitch was amazing but not nearly as difficult to climb or protect as people are making it seem. A #4 helps a lot for psychological purposes, because you can shove it in that huge flake right before doing the crux traverse, although you do have to play with it to get a solid placement since the crack is a bit flaring. I actually found the short 3rd pitch to be the crux of the climb. Exiting that overhanging finger crack by pulling over the small roof was quite spicy on lead, as there were next to no feet and I ended up having to lock off a crimp to get my feet up and pray there was something better above (luckily, there was a thank-God jug!). Knowing how to crack climb definitely helps (esp. for 2nd pitch), and if you don't, I could see where people would find the route sandbagged, but if you do, it's an incredibly fun climb.

        Had to bail off Bastille due to weather a week ago and left a #0.75 Black Diamond with a green biner on it halfway up the first pitch. If you happened grab this and want to return it, give me a call 3306963878.

        Climbed for the first time today. Found it to be much harder than Rewritten. Take as many #3s as your heart desires for sewing up the 2nd pitch.

        The Bastille Crack is, in many climbers opinion, one of the best moderate multi+pitch routes in North America. If you have strong lead+climbing skills at the 5.8 level, a competent, experienced partner, and the weather is nay cold, you should have a blast. (If either of you flail on the first 1/2 pitch .. heed the Gods and rappel at the chains, otherwise all kinds of negative are likely to manifest.) Enjoy the crack climbing by making the moves slowly, with the joy of physical movement. Be courteous and graceful at the base, and en route, as the desire to climb this route can result in amped up emotions amongst fellow humanoid rock climbers.... Pay homage to our passionate & ballsy & talented patriarch, tight+wire walker (sans leash) Ivy Baldwin at the top by clipping the 1" steel anchor cables. Then perhaps head up to the Visitors Center, and watch the DVD of the history of the Canyon with footage of Mr. Ivy Baldwin's high wire walks  (and then hit the pool (now heated, summer 2016,) for a grrreat way to soak it all in). Enjoy.

        This was my first rope solo back in 1975, and after decades away, my wife and I made a quick overnight trip in and out of town last year so I could do a fortieth anniversary rope solo of it.  Unfortunately, however, we were so tired we ended up oversleeping in the hotel that morning and found the usual conga line on the route and in line when we got there. I was pretty bummed, because I only had a few hours available for the climb and it clearly wasn't going to be happening from the end of the line at the rate things were moving. Then all of a sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, dark clouds and a truly fierce wind came up along with some rain, so everyone in line scattered and the first two parties on the route bailed. Once everyone dispersed, I was able to jump on it and was lucky the wind edged back a bit and the rain became intermittent. All in all, it all made for a fairly wild and somewhat less-than-casual go of it, and I felt incredibly lucky to have been able to do it again.  But the most striking thing about the whole experience wasn't so much the climb but rather that so little had changed in Eldo and on the route itself since 1975. It was like being whisked back through the decades in a time machine - I still can't get over how odd that aspect of it felt. On top of that every other move and placement was like running into a long lost friend with all kinds of memories flooding back. It was also a treat to be able to lay a hand on Ivy Baldwin's cable at the top.  Say what you will, but it's as timeless a classic as they come.

        P4 variation - what is it? Went straight up from the belay instead of traversing left. Still crossed the traversing gap but then set up the belay by the pin and headed straight up through some easy roof moves (harder than 5.6 though). This seem to be the harder variation described but haven't found any info on a name or thoughts on the rating. Just curious.  P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack, and climb it to a corner. ****Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.**** Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.

        Bailed at the top of P3 yesterday (11/6/16) (partner was panicking and we had run out of daylight), I had to leave a #0.75 Cam, a green DMM biner, and a locking biner at a piton lower down. If anyone recovers them, it would be great if you could reach out to me to return them.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is basically a direct finish to the crack on the first pitch of X-M and actually finishes at the bolt anchors atop Wide Country.  Follow the X-M crack up the face. When the crack turns from a bomber lieback to fingers and hands is where X-M moves right into the ugly chimney to finish atop the pillar. If you want to do Interceptor, continue up the crack until it peters out at the base of a nice face/scoop.  Place a good TCU here (strenuous) and move up into the face via thin edges. A final crimp moves gets you over the bulge and into the middle of the scoop, where you can drape a sling around a flake for protection. Easier climbing leads up and left to the anchors on Wide Country.Protection Standard Eldo rack with an emphasis on finger-hand sized cams and a long sling to drape over a flake.

        I think that this is one of the better pitches in Eldo.  Deserves 3 stars.




        By  Rob KepleyFrom: Westminster,COMay 26, 2006 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1913624640').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Just got back from Eldo this morning and climbed this route.  What an outstanding pitch!  Interceptor epitomizes Eldo climbing.  Once you get out of the crack just keep your head in "check" until you can drape a sling over the flake.  The moves are all there, just spicey.  Three stars for sure.  I would recommend this pitch to anyone who climbs this grade at Eldo.




        By  Josh JanesGeneral AdminJun 7, 2006$(function(){$('#stars_787002303').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        This is probably my favorite pitch on the Bastille -- classic Eldo.  I think the only R section is the easy climbing early on.  While a fall from the upper face/crux (before slinging the flake) could be big, it would also be nothing but air, in fact, I actually think it is a great pitch to push one's mental barriers on lead.  The second photo of Rob Kepley leading shows the location of the green Alien or similar piece (his highest piece), but one should also note that gear to back it up (a green or red camalot) can be had underneath the flake he's standing on.




        By  Joseph CrottyFrom: Broomfield, COJun 8, 2006 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1475085893').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Josh and Rob are right, an overlooked classic for sure.  On my redpoint, I opted for a red Camalot about a foot below where Rob placed the micro Camalot in the photo, which I skipped.  The classic conundrum of more pro or go is encountered.  Those that can onsight I applaud as this un-Eldo gem is tough to decipher.




        By  Matt BattagliaSep 14, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_119266170').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        I'm perdy dang sure the FA is Rob Candeleria, CATS Rob.  Great route with one critical sequence to read, other than that just great keep-your-head-together Eldo climbing.




        By  Chris ArcherSep 15, 2008 rating:  5.11 6c+ 23 VIII- 23 E4 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_2009897630').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Based solely on the last 2 editions of Rossiter's guides to Eldo (1989 & 2000), the FA is listed as Christian and Dale in 1984 (or perhaps the Kid in '77).




        By  adam brinkFrom: Boulder, COMay 18, 2009 rating:  5.11a 6c 22 VII+ 22 E3 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_1171233296').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Stellar climbing that seems to go on forever!  This must have been 100 feet to the anchors and none of it boring.  While this might be R rated for the first thirty feet (and it's only 5.7 there), after that it is safe with only the chance for a long, clean fall.  Another Eldo gem.




        By  Phil LauffenFrom: The BubbleAug 26, 2011


        I fell a good ways several times onto a red C3 in the green Alien placement mentioned above. I bent the $&%# out of it. I recommend either a flexible cam, like an Alien, or just going with the red C4 that's about a foot below that (I tested the red C4, it's good!).  The beginning is a little scary, and I did a lot of traversing around. It looks like there are two possible ways to go, and of course the other way looks easier than the way you are attempting at the time... a little sketchy. You have to pull a "5.7" move (think the crux of the Bastille Crack) with no gear about fifteen-twenty feet above a bad landing.




        By  WadeMApr 22, 2016 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1703077291').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Great pitch!  Single rack of finger and maybe doubles on 1.  I placed a #2 (not great) and a 0.75 (bomber) before the crux runout, number 1 would have been better.  You can get in something smaller higher, but honestly that would be a speedbump.  High quality but definitely R (a safe clean long fall).




        By  Richard BorderFrom: Boulder, COAug 8, 2016


        Protected the crux runout with a # 1 Camalot right next to the last good hand jam. About 1 - 2 ft below the optional micro cam placement. Whipped 25' at the crux, and I can testify that the gear is good :) Fantastic route.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description One of the beauties of climbing on the north side of the Bastille is the ability to combine pitches from neighboring routes, in effect selecting the "tour" you want to climb.  One such excursion, dubbed "The Spice Tour", takes on several runout, serious pitches which together form a cohesive climb.    Begin with "Interceptor" (5.11b PG-13), a beautiful pitch of face climbing which heads straight up from the "direct start" to XM, on the north side of the Bastille between Wide Country and the Northwest Corner.  A moderate, runout section leads to the crack-flake (fixed pins) just left of the obvious offwidth start to XM.  Place gear as high as possible in the flake, and when it ends punch straight up onto the blank slab (a green Alien can be placed before the hard move).  Have a long runner handy to wrap a flake for pro on the 5.10 slab.  Now climb easily to the chain anchors at a small stance (the top of Wide Country P1, and XM P2).    Pitch two climbs "Inner Space" 5.11b R/X.  Head out right from the belay past a superfluous bolt, to a corner (directly above the crux of the NW Corner) and climb up and left to a left-leaning flake overlap.  Place gear, then runout 25 feet on thin face (5.10a X) to a bulge with a seam-crack in it (good pro).  Now climb a short, difficult 5.11b section, and climb straight up the crack (5.9, you are now on upper XM) to the large ledge at the base of the upper Bastille headwall (below the last pitch of Outer Space).    Pitch three climbs "Saturnalia", 5.11b PG, an exciting direct finish on the headwall.  Climb a short but unprotected 5.8 section on slopey jugs (watch loose rock) to a bolt.  Make a difficult pull, then up and slightly left to a second bolt.  Climb the short, left-facing corner directly above the bolt (5.11b) to a hollow-sounding flake system which leads up, slightly left, then back right to the top.  A direct finish, climbing out right from the flakes, has been toproped, but so far (to my knowledge) has not been led (5.11c or d).    There, you've done "The Spice Tour".Protection Standard Eldo rack, with RPs, Aliens to a 2.5" cam.

        Wow!  Got on this wild route recently and we completed the first 2 pitches (ran out of time to do the 3rd).  Although I got scared and backed off the 1st pitch, it wasn't too bad in retrospect, with pro at your feet during the crux moves (the green Alien), then much easier moves to the flake pro mentioned above.  The next pitch (Inner Space) was much scarier, real glad I wasn't leading that!  The crux felt very technical, even for Eldo, and I would rate it 11c.... at least the pro there was reasonable, pretty good gear at your feet as you start the hard moves.  The dihedral above that was very funky and awkward and felt like solid 5.10, but the pro here was decent.  The quality is absolutely excellent throughout, funny how some of the best routes in Eldo are the spiciest!

        An outstanding link-up!  Climbed this today with my bro Joe.  I got Interceptor and Saturnalia, he sent Inner Space.  Interceptor is such a classic pitch.  Just keep it together, the run-out is not too bad.  I followed Inner Space after this.  This is one fantastic journey up the Bastille.  It wasn't quite as desperate as I thought it would be.  All the really big run-outs are on moderate rock.  I think the spookiest part on lead would be getting over to the top of the Northwest Corner.  There is absolutely no pro in this section.  The crux is protected with bomber pro at your feet.  Saturnalia was a good pitch.  It sorta wanders a bit.  Totally out of character with the previous two pitches.  All in all, The Spice Tour is great climb.

        Well.... That was exciting.  The Spice Tour is a great way to feel born again through rock climbing.  Interceptor is on the soft side of R but really really good and perhaps the difficulty crux.  Saturnalia will feel like piss by the time you get there.  Really the crux of this worthy linkup comes down to the aptly named Inner Space pitch.  I was definitely finding my inner happy place up there.  I would call Inner Space R/X serious and a big step up from Jules Verne.  If you came off at the end of the run out... well... I can't imagine anything good would come of it.  Maybe after your 70 foot slab slapping whipper you'd be fine, but if I were a betting man, I'd put money on broken sticks.  I actually found the "10a" runout to be quite stout, technical, insecure and improbable, and the rock is a little friable, but if you are solid on 5.11 and have a cool head, it should be fine.  A good attention to detail is imperative.  If you read this in the next couple days... now is a good time to go do it, because with chalk on the route, I think it's a little less daunting.  Be prepared to clean lichen off the foot holds right at the point of no return crux about 15 or so feet into the run out! By the time you get the bomber pro before the "crux", you will not be afraid to climb 5.11 with gear at your feet!  I'm truly in awe that Jeff Lowe and John Baldwin, who I believe did the FA of Inner Space, had such big balls and technical climbing ability back in 1978.  Those guys were Heroes.  A route like this would be pretty forgettable with two bolts in the run out, but as it stands... I think you'd be hard pressed to forget this one.  Climbs like this remind me why I love climbing.  Get on it, it's awesome!

        Cedar, Nicely done! John Baldwin and myself watched you lead the Inner Space part of this the other day. We were the clowns yellin' at ya to go right when you were lookin' left.  Having led Inner Space 4 times myself, it was great to watch someone else on it from across the creek. Puts the run out into a new perspective. As you know from the point of no return till you "finally" get to the bomber stopper placement is a defining moment in yer Eldoexperience as in "thank God or whoever"! Rarely gets done...imagine that. John Baldwin always reminds me that Jeff Lowe wanted to call it the Giraffe's Neck, as in ya gotta stick your neck out!  Nice send. Peace. Steve Sangdahl P.S. We call the Intercepter to Innerspace link up Interspace.

        Wow! Inner Space is really what it comes down to. I got the onsight yesterday after fearing it for so many years. It has quite a reputation. My thoughts on it: there are two scary parts 1) from the belay to the Northwest Corner 2) from that flake to the 5.11 crux. This route is a big step up from Jules Verne. There was a lot of lichen, but it never really got in the way. If you're confident and know you WON'T fall on 5.10, then go for it. In the end, it wasn't as bad as I envisioned, but it's still a serious pitch. Where falling on some parts would land you in the hospital, or worse. Great climb!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This route sees some traffic, but is one of the less-traveled 'popular' routes on the Bastille. The name, Wide Country, does nothing to describe the cracks in it, which are seldom larger than small-stoppers. The name more well describe the amount of territory covered in order to climb the route - lots of back and forth and rising traverses, some of which are not closely protected. The route is good, with a typical Eldo crux on the first pitch. It's thin, a little off balance, and committing, but well protected. After the crux, the route lets up enough to let you recover from your pump, or climb despite it. The second pitch is more obscure and less protectable, but can be avoided by doing the (superior) finish on X-M to Outer Space.   To climb the route: P1: Begin to the right of Bastille Crack and start up into a shallow, left-facing, 5.9 dihedral, climbing up past scant protection (if you bother with any) and after some distance getting gear and stepping right into a second, more broken corner system. At the top of these cracks, perhaps 70' up, you arrive at a decent fixed pin, and then a bolt. Clip the pin with a long runner, then the bolt with a short one, then go hard left through the crux. 2 bolts lie above this previous pin, but are of a different route. From the bolt go up and left on mild runouts through easier territory, aiming for the bottom left side of a hanging flake.  Place gear along the way on long runners if desired. On the hanging flake, you can place a 0.75" (+/-) cam or two on a long runner on its left side before launching out under it and up under it to the right, where another cam can be placed 1-1.5" before rising up under the flake (5.10b/c, S?) to a right-facing corner to reach the bolt and chain anchor. According to the Rossiter book, the climbing can be made easier but no less runout by traversing out on the face and then climbing upwards to skip the rise under the flake. The bolted belay is good; it would require 2 ropes to rap from.  P2-P3: An obscure and seldom done line traverses directly left from the belay and then climbs up a fairly indistinct line parallel to the Bastille Crack. (with a fixed pin at the first crux, and gear at the second). Then follow a left-facing corner (10b,S) left of Hairstyles and Attitudes to the top.  P2-P3: Better yet, from the bolted belay, continue on X-M to Outer Space or one of the many other possibilities.Protection A few fixed pieces along the way, particularly protecting the crux. The trad gear is RP's + stoppers + narrow cams to 2". Don't bother with doubles of anything. Take a good number of 2' runners. There are significant runouts in the 5.9-5.10- grade, but after the crux, falls would probably be clean and relatively safe.

        Also, if you do the entire route (which nobody does) you will agree that the crux of the climb is moving left from the XM belay, which involves a move harder than anything on the first pitch.  See "The Direct North Face" for a description of the "route" as it is commonly done these days.-SL




        By  stephen sangdahlJul 18, 2003


        The third pitch is a "must do" for all us sandstone junkyard junkies.




        By  kevin donaldNov 15, 2004


        I agree with the comment by Anonymous Coward that: "the traverse to the left off  the  XM belay is the crux of the climb" rarely is this interesting  little piece of climbing attempted. In all my years around Eldo I've never seen anyone even try it.  It's a mystifying no-hands high step onto a nubbin. I've lead this section a few times and must say that when one puts it into  the context  of Duncan Ferguson and Don Peterson in EBs on-sighting it ... it's really quite impressive. Try it and see for yourself. It's a bit of a run-out and may give you a dry throat! Kevin Worrall and I did a nice finish to this climb as well. The climbing extends the original line and maintains the standard and personality of the route. Description of the pitch is in Steve Levin's Eldorado climbing guidebook.




        By  Umph!Oct 5, 2005


        This was one of the harder 11a climbs I've attempted in Eldo. The slightly awkward and fairly scary though short crux seems a bit harder than 11a to me - also, if you blow it you'll swing down and right, into the small broken dihedral that you traversed from (could hurt quite a bit). Granted, I hate to fall, so a mental edge is needed here, and for the RO that follows the crux. The RO sections of 5.9 climbing that precede the crux aren't too bad, and the climbing is really nice; though a fall shouldn't be considered a choice. I'd certainly give this climb a balzy rating. BTW, the rock is absolutely bomber.

        I did the first pitch again today.  Even more classic than I remember.  One thing concerned me, though.  There is a block that you have to pull on at the end of some run-out climbing just before the crux.  It is actually what you're standing on just before launching into the crux.  This block sounded very loose when I tapped on it.  Perhaps it has always been this way, and I've just never noticed before.  Does anyone know whether it has always been loose, or has it only become so recently?  The above comment about the rock being absolutely bomber makes me wonder.  Anywhay, be careful, but don't be deterred.  Just try not to pull out on it.

        Sick Onsight, if you are reading this page to gather beta before you climb it you are missing out on a great gut check.  Stop reading now while you still can!  Even with beta I think it's a stout lead, it seemed more scary than XM.  Bring lots of runners and balls.  Don't fall it looks like it hurts more than your ego.

        I really enjoy this climb, it's a great quick single pitch to do in the summer. I don't feel that it's particularly dangerous, all the runouts are on much easier ground and the crux is very safe (though hard!).  I found that double ropes really helped to maximize the pro on this pitch.




        By  Lisa MontgomeryFrom: Golden, COSep 10, 2014


        After the crux at the bolt, you can place a finger-sized piece or nut in a crack near the Bastille Crack attached with a double-length runner.    Save a 0.75, red Alien, and yellow Alien for the top.




        By  seanmo63Sep 3, 2016 rating:  5.11a 6c 22 VII+ 22 E3 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_1012314908').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        The crux is insecure but safe on a big shiny bolt, although clipping that bolt is a little spooky and reachy from a just barely secure stance. The runouts are indeed on easier terrain and probably warrant an R rating (clean but looong), but if you pulled the crux, then there's no way you're going to botch those moves.  Agree with Scott that it's a great summertime Eldo pitch early in the morning.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Saturnalia is a single pitch climb worthy of a star or two, but comes on top of 2-3 other pitches of good rock and good climbing. All-in-all, I don't know of a way to get this route without doing at least 2-star climbing.  Climb Bastille to Outer Space, or X-M to reach the big sloping ledge as for the final pitch of Outer Space. From the base of the last pitch of Outer Space, traverse up and right on the ledge perhaps an additional 10-15 feet. You will see a brown-painted bolt hanger overhead at the lip of the overhang. Build the belay for the base here.   Climb chalked up holds from the ledge upward and left to reach a few stopper placements (good #4 and #12 BD, or Eq size) which are nice, considering one loose hold immediately above them. Continue up and left to the jugs and the clip (reachy for short people) and then pull the lip of the overhang (5.10) and establish yourself on the upper wall. Climb up a slightly wandering, but obvious line of holds, passing a few placements to reach a 'diagonal/horizontal' crack (2-3.5" cams) and then up and left towards the second bolt. Clipping the second bolt can be done from the best holds if you are very tall. If you are of average height, it will be thinner holds for a strenuous clip. If you are short, it might be a little ennervating. After clipping the bolt, continue up past thinning, improbable holds to the left, directly, or to the right have all been done (3 ppl's beta, 3 different ways) but each are difficult. Establish yourself on a sloping ledge with a few juggy holds and place gear in a crack low and to the left (large stopper + .75-1" cam). From there, continue straight up on 'Lost In Space' (5.9, R 'lost with spice?') on a few questionable looking holds and not much protection, or start up and then traverse left to Outer Space (5.10-, but better protection).  This is not a good climb to do on a hot, slimy day.  Beware of loose rock!Protection The crux is protected by a bolt at your feet, but there are other considerable moves with trad gear or little gear at all protecting the fall. A rack with a single set of muts and cams 0.5"-3" is probably as good as you can do. [The] larger cams fit in a horizontal placement before the crux bolt and do add mental comfort/security to the long moves to reach the clip.

        Seconding Tony on this, I damaged a hold below the first bolt (see the first picture below).  It's loose but I couldn't totally pull it off.  If you elect to run it out to the first bolt, this hold could be a nasty surprise.  If you place the nuts shown in the picture, you will be fine.  If you think you can remove the baseball-sized loose part safely, please do.  It will not drastically affect the difficulty of the climb.




        By  HillJul 22, 2003


        Following Bryson on this route, I too encounter loose rock below the first bolt. Use extreme caution in this area, as it is very likey that any rock knocked off will land on the road below. And there is plenty of loose rock in this section. I broke off a foot hold yesterday, which scared the hell out of me, but did sail clear of people on XM.  Yikes!!  I think staying low and traversing out left after putting (or cleaning) gear in the crack will help you avoid the worst section of rock, though this may add to the difficulty.

        One star, at most.  Loose, yes.  Spice, yes.  Didn't pass mustard on public nor FHRC vote first time through.  Persistence on the part of the retro-bolter did push it through the second time.




        By  stevedMar 1, 2007


        Clipping the 1st bolt can also be done solidly from a big side-pull on the left and this is better for a shorter person. Or anyone really.  Yes, traversing lower past those 1st nuts is better - I didn't use that "loose" hold for much more than balance but if someone wants to pry it off then go for it.  Yes, I did rap down to clean what I could, and did hang slings .... from RPs. Mea Culpa.   If Charlie did lead it, then he must have used some other Very Loose Holds that were balanced up there...not to mention front-pointing on the lichen I cleaned. Lichen grows very slowly so maybe it was Lewis & Clark who did the FA....  This is a serious route, but not 'very serious'. It's not "for the masses" If you're not up for it then fine, but don't whine about it.

        Regarding the first ascent. I did not know that there was new first ascent standard in Eldorado, the "rumor has it" standard. If we start with that, we will never end. Steve, I think it is best to do your fact checking correctly and explain who, what, when, and where rather than starting a cascade of dubious revisions. Now I am concerned to think that you might be writing a guidebook to this area. The "rumor has it" guidebook is bound to be an interesting one....  Saturnalia, together with Innerspace, is one of the better pitches in the Bastille. It is a great final pitch to many of the cool three pitch link-ups that the Bastille has to offer. It provides a great alternative to the often crowded and overclimbed Outerspace. I like very much the fact that it provides a bit of pumpy climbing over the roof, as well as a techincal, thin crux higher up. If finished via Lost in Space, it is just a great pitch. As for loose rock, I don't think there is any at all, but of course that is a subjective appreciation.  I think it deserves 3 stars. rolo




        By  jack robertsApr 5, 2007


        Saturnalia is certainly a worthwhile route to finish on.  Pumpy, rough rock and a thin, balancy sequence at the end make it all the more satisfying.  But there is loose rock up there, and it isn't as good or sustained as some other climbing on other, three-star routes.  I give it two stars for quality.  Rumor has it that Charlie climbed just about everything in Eldorado Canyon. Mentioning this isn't an attempt to set a standard by which first ascents are graded.  Merely a way of keeping people honest.  Giving historical value. When it comes to trad first ascents in Eldorado, one can't always be sure that someone hasn't come before.  At the time, when the name was proposed there was a lot of speculation about who might have first climbed the rock that became the route known as Saturnalia before Michael and Steve got their fair due. It only adds interest that CF might have gone up there before anyone else.  Who knows?  Maybe Duncan soloed the thing.

        Three stars for sure!  Pumpy, overhanging climbing to airy arete slapping and crimping; how could this not be three stars?  Seems 90% of the loose rock has been taken off by past parties.  We too found that square hold (on the traverse to the first bolt) to be loose, so we took it home.  Thanks to all who cleaned the route.  After getting to the first bolt, I took a huge sigh of relief, and was pleased to find no more long/dangerous runouts. I was also happy to be very tall while clipping the second bolt!  All and all, great climb.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is a serious lead and even more serious for the second. Let me jump ahead to the crux second pitch. The second pitch contains a 20+' traverse after the crux. To protect your second consider a) double ropes, b) solo the pitch, c) rappel and clean the gear, d) have the best climber follow the pitch and hope they don't come off.  Start about 20' right of the start of the Bastille Crack, 10' left of the cave at the base of the Bastille.  P1. Climb up through a series of runout, left-facing dihedrals (7 vs) to an ramping left facing corner. This section contains three pitons of marginal to poor quality, it is very easy to back these up. Continue up the hand crack (10b) and move right at a piton. At this point you're stepping into the base of the detached X-M pinnacle. Grovel up the chimney to the bolted belay on the top of the X-M pinnacle.  P2. From the bolts move back left and down to the left most edge of the X-M pinnacle. Place small wires (RPs) as best you can here. Step onto the left side of the arete and make the crux face moves. The crux is relatively short, then you have 10-15 of 5.9 traversing before you reach easier ground and gear possibilities. Rossiter shows a pin on the topo, but I did not see it. At a shallow, right-facing corner, continue up easier terrain to a bolted belay (watch for bird poop here).  P3. You can either climb up and left or out easier terrain to the right. I lead the right hand variation. From the belay climb up, clip a piton and hand-traverse left. Mantel up on the narrow ledge. From here I continued up to the base of the 10b section of Outer Space.  Rossiter describes a different finish, but continuing onto Outer Space provides a great linkup.Protection Rack up to a #2.5 Friend, RPs.

        Have not done this route, but I distinctly remember a Bill Wright TR where he describes falling on the P2 crux as the second climber, and not swinging at all.  His partner, he said, was able to creatively place a stopper back right after the crux.  Unfortunately this TR was only on my e-mail inbox and somehow got deleted...it isn't on Bill's website.  Anybody familiar with this?

        I did not see any nut placements out right post-crux.  I have led and followed the second pitch and found it scarier to follow.  If the second is really worried, it's not that hard to tie off short, use the extra rope to thread the anchor atop pitch one and give yourself a back belay (probably easier with a grigri).  It's the same idea as lowering yourself out from an anchor on an aid route.  Tom Isaacson

        There are 2 possible brass-nut placements just around the corner from the flake-belay. I used 2 HB micronuts (not offsets) These can be placed from a good (not pumpy) stance at the corner if you can do a near-splits (or are very tall, which I am not) or from a slightly off-balance stance once arount the corner on the face holds.  A few more things- yes, the old KB's on Pitch 3 will hold a 30' fall. That was me on Sunday. It might be a little harder in the heat/sun. Do it before the sun hits in if on a summer afternoon.  The route should get 2*'s. Great route, but not the best.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        for pitch 2, the climbing becomes easy after the crux, and so if the stronger climber is leading, it would be advised to run it to the belay or as far as he/she finds comfortable.  this will make the swing of the second less substantial (more like a toprope than traverse) and will make it easy to get back on the route after the fall.  even better, climb the route with two solid 5.10 leaders, no falls, no worries.




        By  Bill WrightSep 13, 2001


        As Charles states above, it is quite possible to place good gear for the second on the 2nd pitch. After completing the crux, climb up and set left a few feet to a good stance. From here it isn't hard to reach back to the right and place good gear directly above the crux. The second is completely safe now. I did indeed fall off while following the crux. I went only a couple feet to the left and was able to get back on and do the crux the second time. My advice on the crux - step onto the wall as low as possible. Once that is done, heading up involves only a single hard move.




        By  Anonymous CowardNov 1, 2001


        If you don't have HB's there is a really solid #3 Black Diamond Micro Stopper (steel-head) in the seam at the crux.  Reach up high and slide it down until it catches.




        By  steve dieckhoffNov 1, 2001


        On P2 the leader can back-clean even to the point of  clipping the anchor and downclimbing the easy  dihedral....after that it's fairly easy to climb out right from  the belay and clip into the bolt on INNER SPACE (the  only real use for that bolt)--this will give the second a  good toprope. They take a little swing but it's not as bad  as they think it'll be.    On P3-the left-hand var.--I usually place a very small  but solid RP next to the crux 'long reach' move. It goes  into a perfect little slot formed on one side by a crystal.  After the long reach it's nice to get a good piece in and I  think the best might be a tri-cam!

        I must say that this route deserves atleast two stars.  Good rock, good moves, good line.  Plus if you combine it with Outer Space, it's one of the most fun/best 5.10's in the canyon if not the front range.




        By  Tom FyffeNov 12, 2001


        I'm with Chris on this one...fantastic quality rock, technical movement and exciting position.

        TWO STARS!!!....




        By  Quinn StevensFrom: Denver, COMar 23, 2002


        If the first two pitches are lead together, then it is definately scarier and more dangerous to be on lead during the crux.  I followed the pitch, thank god, and pulled the crux moves before cleaning the disturbing RP.  I'm fairly confident that had I fallen during the crux, the rp would have kept me from the big swing.  However, the above advice for the leader to reach back right, following the traverse, and placing something for the second is good.  It's impressive to link pitches 1 and 2 together, climbing directly into the crux from the chimney.




        By  Joe CollinsJul 25, 2002$(function(){$('#stars_399463115').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        X-M__Outer Space is one of the best 5.10 routes I've done in Colorado, along with the Scenic Cruise, Yellow Wall/Forrest Finish, and the Book link-ups at Lumpy.  As stated above you can get two RP placements right at the crux, but it takes some work to find the optimal placements.  The nuts are decent, that is they'll probably protect the crux but I certainly wouldn't want to take a big winger (or an 8 footer for that matter) on them. Be solid!! If the leader fires the crux then he/she should have no trouble finsihing the pitch without placing any more gear. The leader can then clip the Inner Space bolt to protect the 2nd as stated above.




        By  Bill WrightJul 25, 2002


        I just noticed that this route has only one star. Bogus! Two stars at least when you combine it with Outer Space.  As stated above, if you combine the first two pitches, it appears to be quite dangerous for the leader. Also, as stated above this route is NOT dangerous for the second even if the leader fails to place the stopper above the crux as indicated above.  Here's the new information. If not combining the second pitch with the first there is a good way to protect the leader. The belayer clips into the bolts at the top of the pillar with a long length of rope and climbs back down to just above and right of the crux moves. Braced in the slot by the pillar and the wall, the belay can now give the leader nearly a toprope for the crux moves! In fact, I wouldn't even bother placing the RP's - the belayer is above you. If you step out low (tricky and balancy), then there is a single hard move to do.




        By  Joe CollinsJul 25, 2002$(function(){$('#stars_1746741887').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Hey Bill-  isn't that the wussy way of doing it?... just kidding.  That actually seems like really good beta for those who want to do the route but might not be the most solid at the grade.  I have heard of people linking the first 2 pitches, but clipping the chains for crux pro... big, big swing potential.  FYI- I think linking the 1st and 2nd pitches is actually much safer than belaying at the chains on top of the pinnacle.  A belay from the chains would likely put an outward force on the delicately placed RPs at the crux, possibly pulling them out.  With the rope running straight down the RPs are more likely to stay put... as it is, the highest RP pulled on me anyway as I did the easy traverse part. That next piece of gear sure is a long way below the RPs though.




        By  Bill WrightJul 26, 2002


        Joe,  I guess it is the wimpy way, but the way you describe leading it (linking the pitches without using the belay anchor), the risk is way too high for someone like myself. I have also heard of people linking the pitches, but clipping the chains with many long slings. Seems like too much hassle to me and your method (of just using the RP's with the next piece way below that) is just too dangerous for me. Hats off to the guys like yourself who have the mental control for such feats!  I should probably also say that I haven't even led the pitch in question! I have belayed two people using this method, though. I need to go lead it. I followed it fine the last time up there.  Bill




        By  Brad BondJul 26, 2002


        If you're gripped about the nut on top of the flake, string additional runners over to the two-bolt anchor to back it up -- the nut would keep you from swinging inside the flake if the micronuts were to fail.   I think it's better to lead this way because if you were to fall on the micronuts, the catch would be very dynamic and they are more likely to hold. If you belay, you're looking at an awkward pull on the nuts as Joe desribes or placing nothing -- either way, a nasty fall for both the leader and belayer.




        By  Bill WrightAug 30, 2002


        I just led the 2nd pitch this morning and I didn't place any RP's at the start of the route. With the belayer positioned correctly, this feels quite safe. Don't fall after the crux move, of course, but then it is easy. Place the stopper underneath the small flake - tricky to find and place because it isn't obvious, but it's there.  I led the third pitch as well and after clipping the three fixed pins, you can place what appears to be a very solid #2 steel RP (might be a #1 - anywhere a really small nut). This placement is not immediately obvious as there are to other placements that are larger, but not very secure and I doubt would hold a fall. This tiny RP doesn't inspire much confidence, but if it held, this pitch would be well protected. If you fell and it pulled, that would be bad, as the pins are well below your feet the crux move.  Great climb!  Bill




        By  Brad BondAug 30, 2002


        That is a sneaky little #2 RP placement on the third pitch! I once managed to slip off after the crux and fell about 10 feet onto it and it held. Glad I didn't find out what woulda happened if it didn't. Scary.

        Three stars when combined with Outer Space.  The first pitch (10b) is a quality stop on the Bastille 1-pitch cragging tour.




        By  Doug RedoshFrom: Anchorage, AlaskaMay 18, 2003


        if you are tall, like me, the crux could be the move out of the handcrack on P1. The crux moves on P2 are tricky to figure out, but once you work on it, it's not that bad (fortunately for me, my partner's gear popped after he passed it, giving me an effective toprope).  The crux on P3 is a reach problem, but not pumpy, like on P1.Don't make the mistake, like we did, of thinking that you can downclimb the ramp to the left from the top of P3.  This led to some rappelling in the dark!




        By  Anonymous CowardMay 19, 2003


        From ramp at top of pitch 3 climb around the corner right to the easy (5.0) exit pitch for W. Butt, Hair City, etc.  Takes about 2 minutes to the top.

        This is one the best multi pitch 5.10's in Eldo when combined with Outer Space.  When done in 3 pitches,  every pitch is 10c and every belay ledge is great.  It has a little bit of every type of climbing that Eldo has to offer.  (squeeze chimney,  liebacks, technical face, steep cracks, mantels, runout face, and overhanging jug pulls)




        By  Ivan RezuchaFrom: Fort Collins, COMay 16, 2004 rating:  5.10c 6b 20 VII 20 E2 5b$(function(){$('#stars_895848174').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Unsure of whose advice to heed regarding linking P1 and P2, I used double ropes with one rope clipped with a long sling to the bolts above the pillar, and the other rope going straight up to the brass nuts. This worked pretty well, but I had a lot of drag trying to rock over onto my left foot after the crux. That was pretty tenuous. With double ropes you can just run the right rope straight up from the P2 crux to the bolt right of the belay that  Steve Dieckhoff mentions above. Looks like a big Crack'n Up will go in above the higher brass nut. Next time...  I actually had more trouble on P1. The first 25' or so are really slick and no gear for a while (but I placed a piece high on Wide Country, and then pulled the rope through after getting gear on route). The moves leading to the step across are awkward. At the step across it's reallly pumpy. I hesitated at the step across, put in a cam above the last pin. Downclimbed about 10'. Tried to rest, went back up, then had to hang.  On P3, the 9 way makes the most sense to me and is the original aid route. It's straight up above the belay, and the gear is good until the hand traverse. But beware!  I followed this pitch, and a small Alien was really stuck. Chuck said, "Maybe the flake expanded when I leaned out on it." Sure enough, I used my nut tool as a mini crowbar, and I could visibly expand the flake (not the smartest thing to do, as I was hanging on another cam in the same flake while working on the stuck cam).  After cleaning the gear, I downclimbed the 9 variation and TR'd the 10 variation on the left. Didn't see that trick wire. Had to pop for the ledge. May not be leading that variation any time soon.

        I really wanted to do the original 4th pitch rather than finishing on Outer Space, although Outer Space sure looked tempting.  We had neglected to read the guidebook, but I knew it went up a dihedral right of Outer Space. I thought it was the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral, but my 1980 Erickson and Ament guides now make it pretty clear that it's the green dihedral much further right.  And that is what we climbed. From the belay above P3, climb up about 20' to where Outer Space traverses in from the left. Move right on the red band to below a small dihedral with 3 pins. I thought I was going to climb this up to the dihedral just right of Outer Space, but it looked way hard. Continue right to a tenuous stance. I had a real hard time here letting go with either hand, but eventually got gear. Make one more hard move up and right to better holds and easier climbing. Continue right to the base of a left facing dihedral with a good crack (finally!). Thinking I was home free, I was surprised to find a hard move half way up the dihedral. The crack runs out, and I had to step left onto a sloped hold on the arete with not much for the hands. One more hard move back right into the corner, and easier climbing to the top.  Erickson says this of the pitch: "Move up a little and angle 30' right, then climb a dihedral . 5.9". Felt harder, 10a S? Ament says, "...with marginal protection traverse right (5.9) across a steep band of rock. Ascend a left-facing dihedral 5.8 [felt much harder to me] near the west edge of the wall. Rossiter's topo looks correct but his text makes the rightward traverse sound short.  Questions: What's the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral? Below that dihedral, what's the dihedral with the 3 pins a short ways right on the XM traverse? Just right and up from those 3 pins is a left facing flake with a pin. What's that? There are lots of routes and variations on this wall. It's hard to figure it all out.

        Here's another testimonial for the quality of the small RP on the 10c variation to the 3rd pitch, and the insecurity of the move.  No need to risk a 25 footer... my foot slipped off the mantle and the RP held... basically a 5 foot fall.  The move isn't that hard, but you mantle with your weight fully on a polished, slanting hold... a strange, insecure move.  Look around for the placement... it isn't immediately obvious, but it's there.




        By  Steve OrrJun 29, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_1108056868').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        FLAKE ON P3 HAS MOVED!  Today (6/20/04), I fell on the right-hand/straight-up variation on P3, pulling two cams and the flake under which I had placed them.  This is the flake that Ivan Rezucha mentioned on 5/16/04 as being loose.  I'm not sure how this has affected the rating on this pitch, as we bailed and did not finish the pitch.  The flake is now sitting (marked "XXX" with chalk) fairly securely on the ledge just up and left of the belay ledge Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare, and the flake landed in his lap.  I'd hate to think what would have happened if the flake had fallen to the base...




        By  Steve OrrJun 30, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_374238192').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        WRONG FLAKE!  In my previous posting, I said that the flake I blew was the same that Ivan mentioned above.  The flake that blew was NOT the hand-traverse flake, but a much smaller undercling flake about 10 feet directly above the belay.

        This is a "heady" route!! Awesome rock and cool moves. My partner led p1&2 together which seemed pretty bold.  I was pretty worried about the big swing following the moves off the pillar. For p3 I tried to go up the left var. but backed off, gear wasn't great, and I couldn't find anything that would keep me off the ledge. so, I went up the right side. All was well, I got to the base of the O.S. dihedral and kept moving right.  I clipped a pin (shoulda clipped two) and started the looong upward traverse right.  I got a ways past tht old janky slightly downward driven pin (about 10-12ft out) and lost a foot on some lichen.  This sent me for a freaking long ass ride!!! We guestimated about 30-35ft!! By far the longest fall I've taken! If that pin pulled it would've added another 30ft to that (my last piece was a good 15ft below).  I finished the pitch but still found no other gear 'til the dihedral.  A lot of lichen and not much chalk tells me most people don't do this pitch. It's a scary pitch I think but well worth doing, and it is part of the original climb.  Outer Face is aloso a good exit option if you don't want to do O.S. again or if someone is on it.




        By  Wyatt PayneFrom: Littleton COAug 12, 2007$(function(){$('#stars_808630784').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Link P1 and P2.  You can use a cordalette to clip the anchors above the pillar just like it was a long draw.  This allows the leader to fall straight down on the nuts if they slime off, and if they do fail you won't take the full ride b/c you will hit the bolts.  when I lead it I didn't have anything long enough to pull off this trick.  So I had my belayer up on the pillar.  That situation would have pulled the nuts around the corner hard to the right if I lost it.  Not confidence inspiring. In fact I wouldn't put a rice cake on them if they pulled into that orientation.  Have fun.

        After contemplating the crux move on p2 for a good twenty minutes I ended up committing to the higher variation with two tiny sidepulls.  Either way, it's one move that is quite exciting.  The RPs there are mental gear.




        By  mike cFrom: goldenJan 17, 2010


        Let's not kid ourselves. In the description, it is written that this climb is a more serious for the second when in fact I have seen many climbers fall from the crux and just swing left 15 feet or so. Yes, I assume it is a little scary to fall from there as a seconding climber. If the leader were to fall and his little manky stopper actaully hold, they'd hit the edge of the big old flake/chimney and it could be nasty, and if for some reason that piece failed they might never walk again.... So, I don't agree that it is more dangerous for the second. I do think that if you do X-M to Outerspace in 3 pitches, it's one of the best 5.10s in the canyon, if not the best.




        By  IanFrom: Boulder, COAug 7, 2010


        Linked the first two pitches, which made sense to me at the time, because if the micro nut blows at the crux, you'd fall down instead of swinging onto the bolted anchor and the pillar. Of course, you're likely to fall further, but I didn't test the theory. The swing is not a big deal for the follower if you place a nut loosely after the traverse. Everything will pull out when you move up and you can claim that you soloed the second pitch. :)




        By  WallyFrom: DenverSep 2, 2011


        Mike C. is totally spot on. The second pitch is very serious for the leader - with bad fall potential (suspect RPs with a bad landing if they blow). A ballsy lead. If the second blows the crux, no big deal - a top roped swing to the left with nothing to hit - I've had two seconds take this fall - they were able to swing back into the start and try again. The suggestion to solo or backclean the pitch doesn't make any sense (i.e. is crazy) to me.  Wally




        By  Max JosephFrom: Boulder, COJul 5, 2012


        Wow, I'm surprised to see almost no mention of the offwidth variation (original free variation?) to the first pitch. The way most of you guys are going sounds a bit hairball. Got up there the other day and it was great! Pretty secure and featured, while still physical. The chockstone seems like it's not going anywhere, and if you want to you could potentially bring a big cam to push through the crux. Doesn't seem to get a ton of traffic, but I'd recommend it for a bit of old school fun.




        By  michalmAug 10, 2016


        The tat around the chockstone at the bottom of the Dalke offwidth will hold a fall. A few months ago, I led the offwidth after clipping the chockstone tat with a sling. After feeling a bit insecure due to grease and funky beta, I started to downclimb from 25-30 feet above the chockstone. I was unable to downclimb the entire way and ended up taking a 40-footer onto the tat and ending up eerily close to the ground. I then grabbed a #6 Camalot and reclimbed the pitch clean. Someone might want to tie some new cord there sometime soon, but it is good enough for now.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description The route between Werks Supp and Bastille Crack on the North face of the Bastille.  Thin, clean and un-polished face climbing make this route worthy, but still dificult.  Consider moving over right to finish on the route Nexus.  The falls could be long, but from the upper face would be fairly clean, assuming you have reached a point of protection.  Protection The protection on this route is not as bad as some others.  Small nuts can be [creatively] placed.  Little wonder the route is rarely done.  I am somewhat surprised that it is not more often done.  You must be solid at the grade to do this route, but if you are, it is not so bad. Finishing on Nexus adds some variety to the route.

        Hmmm, each time I've led this a fixed ring-angle or bolt  about thirty or forty feet up is the first piece of gear. This  is on easy ground after the crux. This route feels like a  VS, or have I been missing something? Anyway, a  favorite, with great 5.9 moves on perfect rock. Be there  ever so many climbers crawling over the Bastille,  there's never a line for Marie Antionette.

        It might be in the range of 20' from the ground, but you can definitely fish in some small nuts/brassies near the line.  I believe I got 3(?) pieces in there just before the balance-crux of the pitch.  Maybe this was not immediately apparent, but there are placements that should hold a fall.  My memory is faded, as we're talking a few years ago, but it seems they were in a seam on the right-hand side of the feature you are climbing and they are pumpy to place.  Yeah, you could & probably would get hurt in a fall, but I don't think that it's a necessary grounder or career-ender.

        I climbed this on Friday 7/6 and got in a bomber red Alien at the top of the finger crack but didn't see any other gear till I was in the rock band where the bolt is located.  The Alien protects the crux mantle as I slipped there and tested it out first hand.  But after the mantle you don't want to fall since the ground is the only thing that's going to stop you at that point.

        Agreed that this should be considered "X" rated. I reached out right to clip the first bolt on "Madame Guillotine", and didn't get any pro until the bolt ~20-30' later. Definite groundfall potential on some 5.9 terrain.   I think I saw the RPs Tony was talking about, they're to the left of the line and I didn't place them because my last piece (the MG bolt) was down and to my right. Either way, the RPs didn't look great. You should probably be comfortable soloing Eldo 5.9 face climbing before getting on this one.  -Scott

        Might as well leave the rope in the pack, because it's only extra weight.

        John Ruger and I made what we thought was the FFA sometime in the '70s.  I'd had the opportunity to check the route out on rappel and made some custom small wires and wire slings to protect the route.  Ruger led the first pitch in fine form on minimal gear, and I crept across the traverse with a few points of protection, including a fixed RURP.  There were no bolts in place.  I've never been back.




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COJun 3, 2014$(function(){$('#stars_1672501637').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Yeah, the first bolt of M.G. can be reached for and clipped prior to the rising traverse here, but there are still no bolts on it. And also agreed that the RPs I placed (actually H.B. "Anchors" and B.D. "Copper-Steel") were most useful without the bolt and perhaps not needed if that is what you are going to do, but I thought at least one of them would have held.  Then again, I don't fall much, and I could be wrong about that. Not falling is by far the best option and going after a lead like this at one's limit would be fool-hardy at best.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Madame Guillotine is a fine sport pitch on the clean, blank-looking face between Werk Supp and Bastille Crack.   Start up Marie Antoinette, a thin crack just to the right of Werk Supp that ends about 20' up. Where the crack ends, embark on a long, rising, bolt-protected traverse to the right (crux). The climbing here is very typical of Eldo: you either have a decent handhold, or a decent foothold, but rarely both!  Before reaching Bastille Crack, continue straight up past more bolts on fun, thin face climbing (5.11). After the last bolt, trend right to meet up with Bastille Crack just below its second belay.  There are a few worthy variations:  If you want a short, single pitch of hard climbing, you can do the crux of MG past the first 4 bolts, and then traverse right into the crux of the Northcutt Start, and finish at the two bolt anchor on that route.  If you want a long, but somewhat easier pitch, you can climb Marie Antoinette through it's crux runout (5.9X), up to the bolt on that route, and then traverse up and right to join the upper half of Madame Guillotine (5.11). Belay on Bastille Crack.  The proudest link-up would be Madame Guillotine into Hairstyles and Attitudes!Protection Many draws and a light rack.   I used a yellow Alien getting up to the first bolt, and then a green and a red Camalot to make the belay on the Bastille Crack at the end of the pitch (fixed pin here as well).

        A few more variations for those looking to enjoy the upper 5.11 section of MG:  You can start on the Northcutt Start, and continue up the thin corner to start clipping bolts on MG. You can also Climb Werk Supp to Nexus into the upper 3 bolts of MG.  All are great variation pitches on good rock!

        News Flash - All nine bolts on Madame Guillotine were recently replaced. All new bolts are 1/2" x 4.75" stainless Powers 5-piece. Allegedly completed by masked bandits with bad attitudes and a beat up Bosch.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Ever wondered to what route those 4 old pins belonged as you rappelled off the first pitch of Werk Supp?  Well here it is.  Find this obscure short pitch just above the first pitch of March of Dimes or starting perhaps 15 feet L of the upper 70 feet of Werk Supp's first pitch on the North Face of the Bastille.  Described by Rossiter's guide as "this pitch parallels the upper half of P1 of Werk Supp on the left."  This route probably warrants the bomb rating for the rock bomb potential at least along the line we took.  From the little saddle behind the March of Dimes buttress, move slightly R and find a bugaboo (or KB?) a few feet off the ground.  You can try to find ways past the pin to the R to avoid touching this huge, tilted, detached flake (now removed) precariously perched up and L of this pin, but neither of us felt it was less than 5.10.  Certainly, moving up and R seemed likely to enter X or VS range (if this is the actual line, you should ignore this next bit about the flake and the rating).  Then again, so did up and L.    Our efforts required a gentle lieback on this flake (now removed) and fearful stepping upon it to traverse L.  The upper part of this flake shifted an inch with gentle outward pressure inward or outward.  Arrggghhhh!  Reminiscent of Cannon Mountain (NH) rock, this huge block could take out the belay or belayer below and would definitely take out a car on the road.  Don't think you're safe yet.  As you gain this up and R ramp, you must face other stacked blocks that make you try to minimize your presence.    Finally, reach a decent angle pin (partially hidden under a lump of grass in the crack) in solid rock.  From here the route is more technically but less psychologically difficult.  Continue up to a KB.  Here you go up and highstep L into a briefly fractured band.  Climb past what-appears-to-be a soft iron pin and reach the belay thankful for metastabilities.  On the positive side, at least none of the 4 pins shift with hand pressure.    Perhaps somethings are better not climbed.Protection 4 pins (in situ), hmmm, not much else.

        I never knew this route existed before Leo's post, so I had to go right out and get it! I have to agree on the bomb, but it's too bad we couldn't tag on a couple of negative stars. This would be minus-**.




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COJun 25, 2004 rating:  5.10a 6a 18 VI+ 18 E1 5a$(function(){$('#stars_118994508').html(starsHtml(2, 'avg'));});


        Well...Seeing people rate a route this badly, I just had to go try it.  On TR though, given the death flake warnings.  First off, I only found 3 of the pins. Second of all it seemed S but not VS.  The 50 pound block loose on top of the death flake was removed with benevolence it now lies 6 meters right of the base of Werks Supp.  The remaining flake will easily hold a climber, but I wouldn't take a big fall on a cam behind it...  The rest of the route was OK. Tricky to lead? Yes.  Sandbagged? Yes.  Minus two stars?  Not that bad. There are numerous hidden holds that bring this into reality.  It's on the shy side of a star, but the route is not a total bomb.

        Tried this route today and I have to agree on the Bomb rating, mainly because of the lack of pro and the large detached flake.  Also it may very well be closer to an 'x', at least the way we did it.  On lead I got forced left from the top of the flake (5.9)  because of the lack of pro, in my opinion, the flake will come off if you fall on the nuts or cams you place behind it.  Above that there is no pro till you get to the third pin if you go right from the top of the flake (.10). If you go straight up from the top of the flake it's probably 9+ but again there is very little in the way of good pro till you get to the third pin.  Never did see the angle piton but it is probably hidden in the grass off to the left someplace.

        About 3 years ago, (on June 25th, 2004 to be more precise) the loose part of the death flake was briefly in the middle of the road.  Now, it's more off on the side.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description A nice TR with challenging moves. Tough balance in general, then fingery with small feet at the reachy-crux. A great little TR problem.  The blunt arete, pinched between the first pitch of the Bastille Crack and the [Northcutt] start holds an interesting line. The bottom of this is easier than it looks, being perhaps 5.10, as you move upwards the route gets harder, but most difficulties can be beaten at a grade no harder than mid 5.11 by using the holds on both sides of the arete and judiciously switching sides on it with the feet. A physical and insecure crux comes when you would least expect it, joining the Northcutt Start route just before [its] crux, perhaps 15 meters up the arete. This move is fingery and on poor feet, but goes surprisingly perhaps as low as 12b. Finish by completing the arete and face to the anchors.  I would say that I am surprised that this route sees no previous mention on this site. Then again, I had passed it by without attention for over a decade of climbing in Eldo.Protection Top rope from an anchor on Bastille crack. There is NO GEAR on this route and the moves are both hard and insecure.

        I remember feeling slightly crestfallen when Derek told me he had done the arete; I had put in my share of tries over many years. More than just a committed soloist, he was an excellent technical climber. Long live the King




        By  Jay SamuelsonFrom: Denver COAug 15, 2009 rating:  5.12a 7a+ 25 VIII+ 25 E5 6a X$(function(){$('#stars_1100823575').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Wow, I thought this route was great. Interesting, thought provoking moves that left me smiling when I got to the top. I would give it three or four stars if it wasn't in Eldo. Makes me wonder if putting bolts in so one could lead it would be a worthwhile endeavor. My hunch though is that 40 feet of .12a in a canyon that hosts so much isn't worth equipping for lead, especially since so few seem to climb it.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description One for the obscure tour.  While it is only feet from the road it took me 18 years to get around to it.  No matter the option taken to finish the route, there are some flaws, and are some nicer sections.  The overall balance makes the route one worth doing for the completist, and not totally worthy of shunning for the rest of the community.  The crux may be in the interesting climbing  (10a) done getting to the shared section of P2 of March Of Dimes, or perhaps that shared section of March of Dimes (10a), or best of all, going slightly right and connecting to the 2nd pitch variant for March Of Dimes (10c) that is just to the right.  In any case, some occasional grit from lack of travel makes this route one for the experienced climber.  Also, note that the route takes poor stoppers and is pretty much tip-sized cams (0.3") for most of the way.  I didn't have that size and was less than pleased with my options for protection a few times.  P1: (70' Cl4, dirty) Start off on the left side of the March Of Dimes Buttress in a junky gully/ramp.  If it has recently rained, this will be mossy and slick, otherwise it is a 4th class scramble.  Belay at a high point above a fairly large tree at a crack just left of March of Dimes.   P2: (105' 5.10, small gear) Look up a right-leaning, low angle corner that leads up and right into a brown and yellow section of wall.  A very large, upright flake punctuates the brown area where rockfall more recent than the surroundings has revealed cleaner stone and a flake that appears to be somewhat precarious.  Head up to that flake on the brown area with the yellow lichen above and right.  Climb either side of it for a crux (left, 10a, right 10c) that is thin (blue Alien, perhaps?) and steep.  Continue up onto lower angle rock and flee right to the belay as for Werk Supp or run it out a little more to the top of the ledge directly over the flake (5.8?) and belay at a good tree.  P3: (5.3- 5.10c, depending) Three choices here:    A. (5.2) up and left around the corner and up a right leaning ramp to get to the rap chains on March of Dimes. B. (5.10c) Directly up P3 of March of Dimes to the chains, just to your right. C. (5.7) Out and right along a long and narrow ramp system to join Bastille Crack and to the top via that climb.Location This route starts off to the left of the March Of Dimes buttress and finishes at the March of Dimes P3 start, or traverses up the same ramp into the Bastille Crack.Protection A standard light rack with an extra 1.5-1.75" cam (green Camalot) and 2 or more tips-sized cams - i.e. blue/purple Alien.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is a short climb with a short crux and is most often top-roped when anyone pays it any attention at all.  Start climbing just left of the rising brown band of the 5.9 start of P1 of March Of Dimes and continue up into a thin (tips) crack and a hard crux, joining M.O.D. at the easy right-facing crack 1/2 way up.Location This variation of the first pitch of March Of Dimes starts just down-canyon (left) of the traditional set of starts.Protection It's not a total lack of gear that makes this route so hard to protect as it is the lack of stances from which to fuss anything in with confidence.  A few small nuts are possible.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This an odd, but very worthy, route on the left side of the North Face of the Bastille. I will describe the pitch the way we did it, joining the tail-end of Madame Guillotine.   Apparently you could continue further right, joining the Bastille Crack earlier and skipping the 11a section on MG, which would probably keep the pitch at 5.10. This would avoid what I thought to be the best climbing, though.   Start up Werk Supp, and follow that route for ~50'. Look for the prominent, undercling flake shooting up and right. Climb delicately out this flake with frequent and good cams (finger to thin-hands size), 5.10. After the flake ends, move right onto a subtle ledge system.   Here, one can apparently traverse into the Bastille Crack (?) or continue straight up past a bolt. You have now joined the upper part of Madame Guillotine. Continue past two more bolts (thin, balance-y crux, 5.11a), and then head up the easy face to join Bastille Crack at its second belay (fixed pin, 1-2" cams).  Both Rossiter's and Levin's guidebooks give this an "R" rating, but I can't see why. Great gear can be had the whole way. Maybe the R is a holdover from before MG was bolted and those bolts were added?  Either way, Nexus is a worthy outing for those who think they've climbed "everything" on the Bastille. It's enjoyable, well-protected easy 5.11 climbing on good (if a bit dirty) rock with great pro.  After joining the Bastille Crack, you have many options. There are no fixed anchors, and you're 140' feet up.  You could traverse down and left to the anchor on Werk Supp and make two single rope rappels down that route.   You could also continue up the Bastille Crack, or traverse further right to finish up Outer Space.  Location NF of the Bastille, between Werk Supp and Bastille Crack.Protection Standard rack up to #1 Camalot for Nexus. Maybe doubles from #0.5-0.75. Plenty of long slings.

        This is a cool way to start a "barber pole" girdle traverse of the Bastille. From Bastille Crack P2, continue on the traverse to Outer Space, but instead of heading up the well-chalked dihedral, continue right on strata to join a dihedral on XM. Take this to the Outer Space ledge, and then continue around the ledge to the West Face and summit from there.  You could probably start further left still, somewhere on March of Dimes, for the longest traverse.  There's not too much shade in Eldo in the summer, we've got to maximize all the climbable surface on the Bastille!




        By  claytownFrom: Boulder, COOct 18, 2010$(function(){$('#stars_1465464226').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Got on this route yesterday. I recommend keeping a red Alien or two for the traverse as I was sketched out on techy, lichenous feet with a piece that prob wouldn't hold a fall when my last bomber piece was 15 - 20' left on Werks Supp. I was confused when I got to the bolt on Madame Guillotine, cuz I thought you're supposed to continue right to Bastille (which looked sketchy). My partner followed this way. To offer her a little pro, I ended up lowering off the bolt, traversing a rail to the bastille and running it out maybe 60 feet so the 1st piece on that route would give some sort of top rope pro instead of forcing a penji whipper to the right on follow. A little strange, but it worked fine. I recommend just sacking up and going straight up the bolts on the 11 pitch to the typical gear anchor atop Bastille P2. Continued into Outer Space for a good, spicy, continuous 10+ / 11- route up the Bastille.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is a fun pitch that I had never seen anyone doing. This is the prominent crack line that diagonals up across the pillar between the first pitches of X-M and Northwest Corner. There appear to be two ways to get to the start of the traverse. The guide describes climbing the major left-facing corner that leads to the X-M chimney. I have no idea how hard this is, or if it's any good. There was chalk on the way we went, which was to do a cool boulder problem through an overhang, about 10 to 12 feet right of the start of X-M, to reach a stance and protection point. Then move right six feet or so to a series of corners and overlaps that are followed up and left to the wad of slings at the base of the X-M chimney (a bit of loose rock, but otherwise fun). Clip the wad (long sling), and follow the traverse line to join Northwest Corner. Save a purple Camalot or equivalent for the traverse (wires can be placed, too, but it's strenuous). It's maybe 5.9 or so to the start of the traverse, and 10c seems right for the typical Eldo scrabbly moves across the pillar. Good stuff.  Rap or lower from the Northwest Corner anchor, or carry on up Northwest Corner or X-M.Protection Standard Eldo rack, with extra long runners and/or double ropes.

        Dougald, I saw you on it last weekend and Commented to my partner "Somebody's on Independent Study. I've never seen anyone else on that before." I did it more or less straight up in 1996 with Mark Spieker, Done this way you just get bad stoppers in bad flakes, and only here and there. It's reminiscent of Marie Antoinette, but harder with some bad holds. I thought it was a scary 5.10c, maybe a few moves that were harder, for the sake of skipping suspect holds.




        By  Matt BattagliaAug 5, 2007


        So a few weeks ago someone told me that this was a great alternative first pitch to NW corner and that it had great gear ("good small wires"), so I got on it and got spooked.  What I found: There is a good purple Camalot right at the crux (didn't have it that day) but it's tough to place and it takes up a key hand hold making the crux harder (I felt) than most 10c's. A decent, purple TCU can be placed from the good stance before the crux and then that frees up the good hold.  Placing the "good small wires" the rest of the way is hard, best to just punch it.  Cool movement. There's a fixed wire/HB brassy on the route after the crux.




        By  Lisa MontgomeryFrom: Golden, COMay 6, 2016


        This is a worthwhile route for the obscure tour. I'd recommend bringing plenty of RPs and small nuts. I placed a #4 Camalot at the nest of slings in the bottom of the OW before starting the traverse. A baggy 0.5 or tight 0.75 fits okay at the crux. I was able to get a good green Alien right after that.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description The route between Werks Supp and Bastille Crack on the North face of the Bastille.  Thin, clean and un-polished face climbing make this route worthy, but still dificult.  Consider moving over right to finish on the route Nexus.  The falls could be long, but from the upper face would be fairly clean, assuming you have reached a point of protection.  Protection The protection on this route is not as bad as some others.  Small nuts can be [creatively] placed.  Little wonder the route is rarely done.  I am somewhat surprised that it is not more often done.  You must be solid at the grade to do this route, but if you are, it is not so bad. Finishing on Nexus adds some variety to the route.

        Hmmm, each time I've led this a fixed ring-angle or bolt  about thirty or forty feet up is the first piece of gear. This  is on easy ground after the crux. This route feels like a  VS, or have I been missing something? Anyway, a  favorite, with great 5.9 moves on perfect rock. Be there  ever so many climbers crawling over the Bastille,  there's never a line for Marie Antionette.

        It might be in the range of 20' from the ground, but you can definitely fish in some small nuts/brassies near the line.  I believe I got 3(?) pieces in there just before the balance-crux of the pitch.  Maybe this was not immediately apparent, but there are placements that should hold a fall.  My memory is faded, as we're talking a few years ago, but it seems they were in a seam on the right-hand side of the feature you are climbing and they are pumpy to place.  Yeah, you could & probably would get hurt in a fall, but I don't think that it's a necessary grounder or career-ender.

        I climbed this on Friday 7/6 and got in a bomber red Alien at the top of the finger crack but didn't see any other gear till I was in the rock band where the bolt is located.  The Alien protects the crux mantle as I slipped there and tested it out first hand.  But after the mantle you don't want to fall since the ground is the only thing that's going to stop you at that point.

        Agreed that this should be considered "X" rated. I reached out right to clip the first bolt on "Madame Guillotine", and didn't get any pro until the bolt ~20-30' later. Definite groundfall potential on some 5.9 terrain.   I think I saw the RPs Tony was talking about, they're to the left of the line and I didn't place them because my last piece (the MG bolt) was down and to my right. Either way, the RPs didn't look great. You should probably be comfortable soloing Eldo 5.9 face climbing before getting on this one.  -Scott

        Might as well leave the rope in the pack, because it's only extra weight.

        John Ruger and I made what we thought was the FFA sometime in the '70s.  I'd had the opportunity to check the route out on rappel and made some custom small wires and wire slings to protect the route.  Ruger led the first pitch in fine form on minimal gear, and I crept across the traverse with a few points of protection, including a fixed RURP.  There were no bolts in place.  I've never been back.




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COJun 3, 2014$(function(){$('#stars_1672501637').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Yeah, the first bolt of M.G. can be reached for and clipped prior to the rising traverse here, but there are still no bolts on it. And also agreed that the RPs I placed (actually H.B. "Anchors" and B.D. "Copper-Steel") were most useful without the bolt and perhaps not needed if that is what you are going to do, but I thought at least one of them would have held.  Then again, I don't fall much, and I could be wrong about that. Not falling is by far the best option and going after a lead like this at one's limit would be fool-hardy at best.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Start on Bastille Crack, but at the top of the initial flake go straight up instead of moving left into BC.  There is a bolt beneath an overlap (crux), then up past a second bolt.  The route then goes right into 'Wide Country'.   Originally a long pitch that paralleled BC with a 5.12 move up high, this was an unfortunate casualty of the 1988 bolt wars that had the belay and protection bolt high on pitch removed.  Location Start as with Bastille Crack.Protection Bolts and thin gear.   Hardly a sewup.

        Rob set the bolts for this with Matt on TR.  When he led it with me belaying, the bolt studs were in, but he carried a bag of hangers and a wrench. So, as he got to each bolt, he slapped on a bit of glue, installed the hanger, then clipped the bolt.  Pretty fun methodology.  There was also a two-bolt belay (at a shelf close to the end of P2 of BC) that made this a great, long pitch.  At the height of the bolt wars, this belay and protection bolt for the upper section were excised.  The climb now  joins 'Wide Country' instead of continuing up.

        Great Route!  Rob told me to get on this route and Interceptors 11c, 2 routes that I think he has FAs of, so I hopped on both.  This route is way harder than Interceptors, maybe even 12a  I had a tough time figuring out which way to go (L, R, up) in the middle of the route about 15 feet before the mini-roof.  In the process, I broke off the biggest foothold I could find making it quite thin there.  Check it out.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This "everyman's" variation avoids the run out start and the 5.11 crux of Wide Country 105760527which is the first pitch of The Direct North Face and allows one to climb the rest of the DNF at only 5.10. The middle pitch of X-M is now the spice crux with this variation.  Climb the Bastille Crack past the chain anchor of the first pitch. At the top of the chimney flare, traverse right, obvious 5.7, into the final 5.10c section of the first pitch of Wide Country. Double runners on any pro above the chains on BC before moving right are helpful to avoid rope drag.  See Steve Levin's description of the DNF for the full route beta.Protection Standard Eldo rack.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is basically a direct finish to the crack on the first pitch of X-M and actually finishes at the bolt anchors atop Wide Country.  Follow the X-M crack up the face. When the crack turns from a bomber lieback to fingers and hands is where X-M moves right into the ugly chimney to finish atop the pillar. If you want to do Interceptor, continue up the crack until it peters out at the base of a nice face/scoop.  Place a good TCU here (strenuous) and move up into the face via thin edges. A final crimp moves gets you over the bulge and into the middle of the scoop, where you can drape a sling around a flake for protection. Easier climbing leads up and left to the anchors on Wide Country.Protection Standard Eldo rack with an emphasis on finger-hand sized cams and a long sling to drape over a flake.

        Also see the route description for The Spice Tour.




        By  Ken DuncanFrom: Ft Collins, COApr 18, 2005 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c$(function(){$('#stars_1636854810').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I think that this is one of the better pitches in Eldo.  Deserves 3 stars.




        By  Rob KepleyFrom: Westminster,COMay 26, 2006 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1913624640').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Just got back from Eldo this morning and climbed this route.  What an outstanding pitch!  Interceptor epitomizes Eldo climbing.  Once you get out of the crack just keep your head in "check" until you can drape a sling over the flake.  The moves are all there, just spicey.  Three stars for sure.  I would recommend this pitch to anyone who climbs this grade at Eldo.




        By  Josh JanesGeneral AdminJun 7, 2006$(function(){$('#stars_787002303').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        This is probably my favorite pitch on the Bastille -- classic Eldo.  I think the only R section is the easy climbing early on.  While a fall from the upper face/crux (before slinging the flake) could be big, it would also be nothing but air, in fact, I actually think it is a great pitch to push one's mental barriers on lead.  The second photo of Rob Kepley leading shows the location of the green Alien or similar piece (his highest piece), but one should also note that gear to back it up (a green or red camalot) can be had underneath the flake he's standing on.




        By  Joseph CrottyFrom: Broomfield, COJun 8, 2006 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1475085893').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Josh and Rob are right, an overlooked classic for sure.  On my redpoint, I opted for a red Camalot about a foot below where Rob placed the micro Camalot in the photo, which I skipped.  The classic conundrum of more pro or go is encountered.  Those that can onsight I applaud as this un-Eldo gem is tough to decipher.




        By  Matt BattagliaSep 14, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_119266170').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        I'm perdy dang sure the FA is Rob Candeleria, CATS Rob.  Great route with one critical sequence to read, other than that just great keep-your-head-together Eldo climbing.




        By  Chris ArcherSep 15, 2008 rating:  5.11 6c+ 23 VIII- 23 E4 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_2009897630').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Based solely on the last 2 editions of Rossiter's guides to Eldo (1989 & 2000), the FA is listed as Christian and Dale in 1984 (or perhaps the Kid in '77).




        By  adam brinkFrom: Boulder, COMay 18, 2009 rating:  5.11a 6c 22 VII+ 22 E3 5c PG13$(function(){$('#stars_1171233296').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Stellar climbing that seems to go on forever!  This must have been 100 feet to the anchors and none of it boring.  While this might be R rated for the first thirty feet (and it's only 5.7 there), after that it is safe with only the chance for a long, clean fall.  Another Eldo gem.




        By  Phil LauffenFrom: The BubbleAug 26, 2011


        I fell a good ways several times onto a red C3 in the green Alien placement mentioned above. I bent the $&%# out of it. I recommend either a flexible cam, like an Alien, or just going with the red C4 that's about a foot below that (I tested the red C4, it's good!).  The beginning is a little scary, and I did a lot of traversing around. It looks like there are two possible ways to go, and of course the other way looks easier than the way you are attempting at the time... a little sketchy. You have to pull a "5.7" move (think the crux of the Bastille Crack) with no gear about fifteen-twenty feet above a bad landing.




        By  WadeMApr 22, 2016 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_1703077291').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Great pitch!  Single rack of finger and maybe doubles on 1.  I placed a #2 (not great) and a 0.75 (bomber) before the crux runout, number 1 would have been better.  You can get in something smaller higher, but honestly that would be a speedbump.  High quality but definitely R (a safe clean long fall).




        By  Richard BorderFrom: Boulder, COAug 8, 2016


        Protected the crux runout with a # 1 Camalot right next to the last good hand jam. About 1 - 2 ft below the optional micro cam placement. Whipped 25' at the crux, and I can testify that the gear is good :) Fantastic route.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is the route between the first pitch of Werk Supp and the beginning of the fourth pitch of the Bastille Crack.  It makes for an excellent day and avoids the line at the bottom of the Bastille Crack.  To get to the route: climb the first pitch of Werk Supp to the bolts 5.8+.  From the bolts, head west up the ramp with an emphasis on the outside of the ramp.  Continue up through a squeeze/overhanging section where a piton marks the crux 5.8.  Once through the crux, cross the ramp and set up shop for the fourth pitch of the Bastille Crack.  Link the last two pitches of the Bastille for a great day.Protection Bring a normal rack; mostly mid-sized pieces.  There is an OK looking piton at the crux.

        There is also a ramp system to up or down-climb between the top of P1 of WerkSupp & top of P2 of Bastille Crack.  This is distinct from the above described line.  The down-climb is useful if you want to bail (rain, hail, whatever) & don't want to leave gear & don't trust a single old pin.  It's much easier than 5.8.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 20, 2005


        Sorry, I meant "third pitch variation."  As a young teen, the third pitch intimidated me for a few years, so I would sneak around the corner to the left and climb the awkward dihedral/slot with the fixed pin.

        I could be wrong, but I do not remember seeing a piton when I climbed this.  Nevertheless, it protected well.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Cross-country connects the blissfully blank Crossfire with the esoteric Wide Country.  Climb Crossfire to just past the first bolt, then angle up and right to the Wide Country corner immediately below the crux, and continue with that route to the belay.  Now choose any of several pitches above, or better (at least for Alex and myself), rappel and go drink beer.  Best done in hot, humid conditions when at least two chronic tendonitis-type injuries have resurfaced for each climber involved.  Protection Rack per standard Eldorado Canyon requirements.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Space Invaders is a worthy variation of Outer Space, doing the harder parts of that climb and then bumping out left to add some 5.11 climbing.  Climb to the upper pitches of Outer Space and start up and left on the final pitch.  After ~ 30 feet of climbing, a small ramp and ledge droping down and left appears on your left-hand side. You will note a bolt within reach of it. Protect the crack of Outer Space with good pro & a long sliing, then go down and left on the sloping slab to get a stance below a bolt, which you climp.Cimb up and left of the bolt on a flake and crack system.  Supposedly a mid-range TCU protects this area, but nothing I could get was worth having. At the top of the flake system, a few necky moves have to be done (5.10, 10' above the bolt, ledge fall potential) do these and clip the second bolt. climb up and left (crux, hard for 11a?) and generally climb up towards the top.  An old two-bolt anchor is at the top if this climb, but they are not suited for rapping on- you can set an anchor up top, if desired.  The best way down is to walk down as for Outer Space or the Bastille Crack.  Presently there is a small but active wasp nest in the pocket just below the 2-bolt anchor. They were not aggressive yesterday.Protection Protection at for Outer Space plus a few quickdraws & a "medium TCU" (that probably wouldn't hold even a short fall anyway).

Description Northcutt Start is a beautiful, short climb with a terrific tempo.    Follow the crack in the corner of the left-facing dihedral 10 feet to the left of The Bastille Crack.  Fantastic jams and laybacks gradually grow more strenuous up the steep corner.  Then move to the right and turn the corner (there's a trick - if you can't figure it out ask someone, and they'll probably be able to tell you).  The first time I got this one I got to the ground and was grinnin' from ear to ear.Protection Smaller pieces, and a nice quickdraw to clip the piton quickly and move on.  You can toprope this via the anchors at the top of the first pitch of the Bastille Crack...assuming that anchor is not already occupied.

        I love the story of the first free ascent.  Ray Northcutt, who must have been strong as an ox since he could do 100 pullups, was incorrectly told that Layton Kor had freed the direct start to the Bastille Crack.  Upon learning this, Northcutt went out the next day and fired the line, only later learning that his was indeed the FFA.    I think this is generally acknowledged to be a bona fide 5.11- pitch nowadays, and when you consider that it was nearly a decade later that Ament, et al. were being credited with climbing the "first" 5.11 routes in the U.S., it serves to emphasize Northcutt's achievement on this short route, as well as the powerful impact one's mindset can have on climbing performance.    Free your mind...




        By  Kreighton BiegerJul 20, 2001


        Well, if you're wondering what Eldo 11- feels like, try this. I didn't get the route, but I can say, in case you're wondering, that the old ring pin (circa 1959??) will hold. At least, as of this morning it held two pretty good whippers from around the corner (and three smaller ones too!). Yes, I made it past the crux and around onto the 'good' slopers and came off. Nonetheless, this is a beautiful route and it is a shame the first part of it doesn't go on for another 100'.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        I find 10d to be a suitable grade, considering the first 30 feet are no harder than 8+, and the crux is so short.  Even if the ring pin did pull/break, the pin below it is great and the gear options below that even better (.75 Camalot).  Also, I find this pitched linked with P2 of the Bastille into Outer Space to be a good warm up to the X-M/Outer Space link-up:  the difficulties are similar, only difference is the quality of gear.




        By  Brian SordenAug 24, 2001


        Adendum to the historical note.  This was the first 5.10 in Colorado, and very possibly the first in America.  Not only was Northcutt sandbagged into doing it in 1959, there wasn't another 5.10 done in Colorado until well into the sixties.  I do support the 10d rating.  The "trick" is a tiny foot cup stemming right onto the arete, two inches below a small upside down triangular lip.




        By  Hayden YurkanisNov 6, 2001


        Great climb!!! Wouldn't consider it to be harder than 10+




        By  Lon BlackApr 29, 2003


        What a sweet pitch.  Ray Northcutt did a hell of a job.  Well Kreighton, that pin on the traverse still holds a fall.  I took one on it today because I'm a dumbass.  It's amazing how much harder a move can be when you don't use your head and eyes to find footholds.

        I toproped this 2 days ago and pulled it right away.  I'm not convinced that I could pull it off as quickly on lead but I'm gonna try!  I didn't have any beta on the route and can't see why people find the move so mysterious.  It was simply hard on my fingertips.  Ouch!




        By  Kurt JohnsonFrom: Estes Park, CONov 2, 2006


        In his mid 70s, Ray still is as strong as an ox. When he shakes your hand he just about breaks it!

        The pin at the crux traverse was still good when I fell on it last week...




        By  tooTALLtimFrom: Boulder, COAug 7, 2007$(function(){$('#stars_476874453').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Amazing climb!  Great crack climbing with an exciting finish.  If you can't lead it (like me), TR it from Bastille's anchors, very fun.




        By  Bruce HildenbrandJan 31, 2008


        You can do a variation at the top of the climb.  Rather than traverse right at the pin, continue up the ever thinning crack to the anchor.  Not much protection for the leader.  On a TR it felt about 5.11b.




        By  tooTALLtimFrom: Boulder, COApr 7, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_151220573').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        The pin is still good :-p




        By  DarrJun 10, 2008


        I had a question on the route.  Can I safely get to the anchors to setup my own top rope?  I'm going to be climbing solo and while I have all the logistics setup so I can do that safely (backups to all of my protection), I need to be able to get up to the top anchors for this route without any protection.  Can it be done without having to go really far out of my way to get up the rock?  Thanks for any help.




        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COJun 10, 2008


        Easiest way to get to the anchors is pitch 1 of Bastille Crack.  So unless you can free solo 5.7, you can't get to the anchors without protection.




        By  GeoffElson ElsonJun 27, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_1733924904').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        The pin is still good, but doesn't really come into play if you put one of your smallest cams in the pocket a few inches to the left, the pocket isn't really essential for the move. I placed a tiny gray TCU, and it fit easily with space on either side.




        By  RiggerMortisFrom: Albuquerque New MexicoJul 11, 2008$(function(){$('#stars_1614369553').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I'd say it's all 5.7 to 5.8 except for the crux move.  BTW, it CAN be done without the mystery foothold.  You just have to place your left foot really high and hang from the sidepull in the dihedral with your left hand while reaching around the corner for a pinky and ring finger lock in the crack.  Then grunt and send.  This worked for me (but my partner swore it wouldn't 'til I did it:)  Might not work if you're short.  I'm 5'10"




        By  Top Rope HeroFrom: Was Estes Park, now homelessApr 29, 2010 rating:  5.11- 6c 22 VIII+ 22 E3 5c$(function(){$('#stars_995434496').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Feels like 5.11 death if'n you've got fat fingers and can only wrench at most your tips at the crux finger lock.  Oh--and decades later, that pin/ring is still holding leader falls....




        By  TBDMay 26, 2010$(function(){$('#stars_792043249').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        The grade isn't really that important to me, but for context this feels harder than the first pitch of Genesis and at least as difficult as the crux on the Northwest Corner.  Fun little route.




        By  Phil LauffenFrom: The BubbleSep 12, 2010 rating:  5.10d 6b+ 21 VII+ 21 E3 5b$(function(){$('#stars_979413701').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        Harder to onsight.... Once you fall on the pin once, you get the general idea, and it's relatively easy.




        By  Marty CombsFrom: Boulder, COApr 7, 2011 rating:  5.11a 6c 22 VII+ 22 E3 5c$(function(){$('#stars_1749420538').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        A superb climb, but it is a little spicy cranking the crux above the 2 old, rusty pitons.  Old pitons are always good until they're not.




        By  NickViatorFrom: Denver, COAug 25, 2013


        Luckily I didn't have to test the ring piton on this climb yesterday, but the party below me took a fall on it and it held.  From what I've read, that piton must have held thousands of falls over the years.  Great short climb nonetheless.




        By  bonnie bonbitsFrom: colorado front rangeJun 6, 2014


        Delicate, thin bits at the crux, yes, but with the piton and good pro just before and after it, it totally goes. Full-on technical bits, definitely not strengthy. So being 5'3" at best, and in Eldo, I'm quite rather surprised by the 5.10"d" rating. Especially since the entire bit to the crux is smooth jammin' and restful climbing (because I'm definitely not an Eldo 5.10 leader, and I've backed off Eldo 5.9s harder than this).




        By  Peter LewisFrom: Bridgton, MaineSep 16, 2014


        I remember falling on that pin in 1983. Nice to know it's still good.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is another "classic" .11- on the north side of the Bastille.    Start near the base of Rain on the (surprising) northwest corner of the Bastille.  Climb up and left via underclings, past a few fixed pins and one tricky move to the top of the pillar and a two bolt anchor (.9).  The next pitch climbs up the left-facing corner, through a small roof (.9+) and up the thin crack (crux). Reach up to clip a bolt and traverse right to a belay at a bolt on the arete.  Pitch three follows the obvious corner above for 40 feet. Move up and right through loose strata to overhung moves along a chalked flake (more pins). Belay on same ledge as for Outer Space.  Pitch four options include outer space and traversing right and up the last pitch of West Buttress.  Overall, this is an enjoyable route.  The crux pitch may feel a little hard for the grade.Protection Standard rack.

        On the crux P2 there are several ways to go from the fixed pins in the thin crack: 1) up the thin crack, 2) a long reach right to a good hold and then a balancy move up to a bolt, or 3) downclimbing a body-length to traverse  right then up. This last sounds convoluted but the  leader will frequently downclimb to get a rest after clipping the pins (or just placing a bombproof small cam) anyway, and this traverse is better if you don't  have a long wingspan.   In any case, I launched up on this once when I wasn't climbing too well, placed the small cam (before the  pins were placed by Chris Archer), traversed out to the 'mantle hold' and lobbed off. It's a surprisingly comfortable fall. ...so much so that I went up and  lobbed off again. I hope this little story serves to encourage people to go up on this classic pitch with  less trepidation.




        By  Tom FyffeNov 12, 2001


        This is a really good route. The crux pitch is a classic shit or get off the pot scenario, but very do-able.




        By  TBDJun 1, 2002


        Fun Climb.  On the crux pitch, the traverse after the crux moves feels a little dicey, if you fall, you'll swing (but on a good bolt).  Also, the fixed pin prior to pulling the small roof to the belay bolt is questionable at best, back it up.  As with all other gear routes on the planet, small aliens are helpful.  The most obvious finish to me was Outer Face, definitely worthwhile.




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 13, 2002


        I climbed this route yesterday and loved it. I did however get pretty sketched out on the 3rd pitch when I pulled on a large flake in the 5.9 section and it moved. The pro at this point is a pin driven behind the same flake. I found it difficult to make the move without yarding straight out on the suspect flake. I also had a hard time clipping the pin just below this one because of the way it sits in the rock, I was standing on some loose strata trying to make this clip. I found the crux 2nd pitch to be very difficult and got spit off a few times but will return to try again since the pro is very good through this section. As Steve said, the fall is clean, I went slightly left after the last pin at the crux..




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 13, 2002


        That's usually done as the third pitch, and yes, be really careful on that shattered band.  Have a Petzl biner handy to clip the difficult pin.  Not a place to be pushing things, regardless of how one approaches the crux pitch...




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 19, 2002


        Your'e right "AC", it was the third pitch and it is no place to push things, I'd say this pitch is more serious than the crux........




        By  Andrew KleinJul 3, 2002


        Has anyone done this route in 2 pitches with a 60m.  Me and my partner came close the other day.  I lead the third, fourth and the easy chimney pitch above and right form the outer space ledge and came about 15 feet short form the top (walk-off ledge).  My partner belayed right after the .9 undercling roof after the crux, because of drag, but still had about 30 feet or so of rope left.  I, of course (on the crux pitch) did the easier variation to the right after the second pin which is a good option for someone following the pitch who wants to keep the climbing easier.  I remember staying in the crack the whole way when I did this last year (following) and remember getting really pumped and hanging quite a bit trying to find some decent feet.  Excellent route and mostly great 5.9 climbing except the crux 25-30 feet.




        By  Dougald MacDonaldAug 1, 2002


        Now that I've  (FINALLY!) led  the  crux without a problem, I think this is a great route. Before it was negative-five stars. If  you're weak, like me, don't stint on gear for  the traverse from the bolt to the belay (assuming you've taken the left variation). You can clip the second bolt at your knees with a long sling. And be  sure to back up the pin at  the end. The exit is not trivial!




        By  Bill WrightAug 29, 2002


        I climbed this route yesterday and it is indeed a great route. On the 3rd pitch, mentioned above, I have some comments. First, the loose flakes are not where the pins are driven. These flakes seemed completely solid to me. Yes, the first pin is difficult to clip and have a small biner for this (Neutrinos work here). The loose flakes below this are a bit freaky but they can be avoided. This section is steep, but short and didn't seem too serious (if the pins hold and they seemed good to me).  The start of the crux pitch is a bit disgusting right now with pigeon shit. Thankfully this only lasts for about ten feet, but it sucks having to fist jam this crack with that shit in there.  I followed the crux pitch and fell off it. What worked best for me was to do the long reach left from the best hold in the crack. This hold is rather low. Then the key is to reach as far as possible on the hold out to the right. Not only is it a better hold the further you reach, but it gives you room to match your right hand on it. This match is by far the crux move on the route, but it is followed with a dicy move to get your foot on this hold and a fall from here would be exciting, though supposedly safe.




        By  Scott ConnerFrom: Lyons, COAug 29, 2002


        Jeez Bill!  You need to be careful!  If one of your calf muscles popped out from three pitches up, it could seriously hurt someone down below.




        By  Bryson SlothowerJun 1, 2003


        I did this route again yesterday and the flake I mentioned above does flex if you pull on it...




        By  Evan SloaneFrom: BoulderAug 11, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_1913644906').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Instead of trending right on the last pitch into the 5.7 finish, do the Outer Face pitch (see separate route listing). This pitch keeps the grade more consistent with the rest of the route and allows you to really follow the prow from base to summit. Good fun.




        By  Mark RothFrom: BoulderMar 16, 2009


        Is the loose rock removed?  Is the route open now?




        By  blakeherringtonApr 15, 2009


        P1/P2  can be linked. From atop p2, a ~65m pitch goes to the summit. I thought that the crux, if climbed straight up, then rightward (long reach to pin scar and desperate pull) felt harder than 5.11a. My partner worked right and then up (past one more pin and another new bolt) and said it felt less strenuous.




        By  Kat AFrom: Bart and Lisa Ville, COJun 26, 2009


        Good to hear Steve Levin's comment on how the 3rd pitch has become more difficult to reach the fixed pin since removal of the block.  Felt scary trying to lock off on one arm, heel hook, and stretch up to the pin just to find my Superfly biner wouldn't fit through the hanger, as I was hanging above sharp loose rocks... maybe there's an easier way to do it (?).




        By  Mike McKinnonFrom: Golden, COJul 27, 2009


        I think I do this different than everyone else. First, the XM start is much nicer and adds another 10 pitch to the climb.  On the crux, I climb over the tiny roof and get my left hand in the good slot between the two pins in the crack. Then I reach out with my left foot and toe in on a tiny edge (out left) and balance forward on that while moving my left hand high and right hand to a gaston in the crack above the pins. My left hand hits a high edge and I pop my feet up and move to better holds right under the bolt. Clip the bolt and move right.  Voila

        While cleaning the crux pitch, my partner effortlessly pulled out the pin that "protected" the crux.  Luckily, great gear abounds!

        Rock climbing at its best!




        By  Bob RotertApr 29, 2015


        Did this today and found the top pin that protected the straight up thin crack version and has been there for 15 plus years is missing. I always thought it looked pretty solid, but I see in a post above that it came out when someone was cleaning the pitch. I don't doubt that it has been fallen upon many times in the past, but over the years with freeze thaw, these things can loosen.  This seemed to me, at the time, that it changes the route quite a bit from when the pin was there. I am in a climbing recovery mode and not really on my game right now, but it seemed like It adds quite a bit more commitment, since that pin used to be quite high in the crack and close to waist level when doing the crux. The crack is pretty flaring in this section, I couldn't get anything good passive pro in up high in the crack, plus it's a very strenuous place to try and place anything, which was the reason why the pin was there to begin with. Getting any good gear in high in the crack, where the pin was, would be difficult if possible at all. You can get a green Alien in just above the existing pin. Seems to me it would be good if some one replaced the pin that feel out. That would return this route to its previous, more friendly character. Or maybe it's not that bad, just not what I was expecting?  08/17/16 update: Now the other pin that was there that was below the green Alien placement I mention above has broken. Part of the pin is still in the crack. I know some may not agree with me, but I am just sayin' what was once a pretty friendly and safe climb, with the pins there, has a much higher commitment and risk factor now.




        By  Brett S.From: ColoradoMay 31, 2015


        Hey Bob, I climbed the route last summer not knowing that there was ever a pin protecting the upper part of the thin crack, and it felt pretty safe. I placed several pieces just below the crack and gunned it through the crux to the bolt. As you say, placing protection in the seam would be strenuous, and honestly, I didn't see any great options. The fall would be pretty big if you came off towards the top of the crack, but I believe it would be safe. The cams below the crack are very good placements.




        By  Robert Daniel.From: Denver, ColoradoJun 11, 2016$(function(){$('#stars_1454932771').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Just want to re-iterate the importance of having a smaller biner ready to go to clip the first pin on the 3rd pitch.




        By  Kishen MangatAug 16, 2016


        Climbed this super route again today. A couple notes - I used a yellow (0.2) BD X4 on the  placement at the base of the P2 crux below the bolt. It was fine, but I would have preferred a green Alien. I linked pitch 2 & 3 and had horrendous rope drag by the time I reached the Outer Sspace ledge. Probably better to break it up. Have fun!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description We did this route instead of waiting for the The Bastille Crack to access Outer Space.  Friends of mine were at Eldo last Memorial Day weekend and said it was dead. That was not the case this year.  If the first pitch we did didn't have a semi-gully section, this route would get another star.  This route starts to the left of Werk Supp. The start is about even with the chain anchors on top of the pillar that people with one rope use for rappel #2 off the first pitch of Werk Supp.  The first pitch (about 5.9)  follows a thin crack after doing some face moves lower.  Protection is better than it looks from the ground.  Continue past the chain anchors, up some less than aesthetic climbing and belay on the ledge at the base of a thin layback crack.  Ascend this crack to its end (10 foot, 8+/9-), move right a bit, and head up varied climbing to another belay ledge.  From this ledge, head right to the crux thin, left leaning crack (10).  The crux is well-protected.  At the end of the crack, move up and right on a low angle, wide dihedral to join the The Bastille Crack.  Finish via the last pitch of the The Bastille Crack or do the variation (8/9) like we did to the right.  The harder sections of this climb were high quality - the first 40 foot of P1, the first 20 foot of P2 and P3 were great.  This climb was well worth doing.  Once you do this climb, it can only be easier (10-), but why repeat a route when there is so much else to do?  Protection Bring a standard rack - #0 TCU/blue Alien up to a #3 Camalot will suffice.

        The 11a alternate start is highly recommended. Start about six feet to the left of the 5.9 start at a thin crack which starts about 5 feet off the ground and runs for about 8 feet.   Step up and place small nuts as high as possible. Clipping directly to the nuts is recommended. Move left and up diagonally to the right to regain the top of the thin crack. From here move slightly right and continue with the remainder of the first pitch.

        The belay anchor after the P3 crux is real funky.  There is a decent root you can tie-off, but otherwise you might need big cams (at least #3 friend, but an OW piece would work in the wide crack), or you may need to reach back into the crux crack and place a couple small pieces to back up the root.  Continuing up the wide crack presents heinous rope drag.




        By  Casey BernalFrom: Arvada, COJun 12, 2002$(function(){$('#stars_1865672015').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        The crux is a nice looking face with a typical Eldo-type crack. It sunk some great nuts but using micro cams would be weird - the nuts were just too good. We only used a green Alien until the top where we used a yellow as a directional. For the crux section we had a bomber #4 stopper then a #5 (the #5 held a fall). This crux might be a little harder if you have large fingers as it is a small crack - I had trouble fishing in my pinky tips in some places. Beautiful face too bad it wasn't longer than 30 feet.

        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COJun 28, 2002


        Agreed, Charles, I try to remember to bring a #3 (or #3.5?) Camalot for the belay at the top of P3.  I think it fits perfectly, and will make your second (and you) feel a lot better as he cranks the final moves.




        By  Bryson SlothowerAug 17, 2002


        Pitch 3 of this route is a good way to end Werks Up, just don't leave all the big pieces you brought for pitch 2 of Werks Up at the belay like I did or your anchor will be sheit.  I have pretty meaty fingers and found the last move to be pretty stout for the grade, cool pitch though..




        By  Darren O'ConnorSep 8, 2002


        Doing the last pitch of this route as a finish to Werk Supp was too fun.  But I changed the grade to 5.8 A1 by hang dogging it.  I was surprised and happy to find better feet than expected.  It looked barren of foot placements, but that was'nt the case.  I was also pleasantly surprised to learn that you didn't have to go all the way to the roof to traverse to the finish.  A note on the pro at the top.  I placed a #2 Camalot around the corner above the crux, then went back down and place a yellow Alien above the crux for my 2nd.  For the belay, I slung a wedged rock near the cam (the cam I ran the rope through to keep a fall from being directly on me).  I also slung a root down low in the wide crack that looked like it would have held fine.  From this description, you can tell I didn't read about this route before doing it and had left the #4 Camalot down below for protection...

        There are actually several possibilities for the first pitch- the first comment gives directions for the 11a variation and talks about going all over- I thought the 11a just fired right up the crack- no left, no right, just up. After the first crack (11a) runs out you can still go more or less straight up (10b). For another variation, you can come in from the lower left up the brown band on well-spaced jugs and then up the left-leaning crack above that. This can be done without stepping out right to the face and instead go right up into the thin crack up high (10b/c)- it protects with small cams and can be backed-up with a so-so 2.5" piece, although that gets in the way a little of the crux hold, it can be done.Further- you can go directly up the blunt arete way out on the right all the way to the top (10b) and the chains. This way is runout.

        Does anyone climb the second pitch of this? Supposedly 5.8. Yesterday I had a harder time following the second pitch than leading the crux third pitch. Pitch 2 is a left leaning left facing dihedral with a blank and dirty left wall. Two short but strenuous sections of laybacking a wide finger crack. Above that is easier runout climbing.




        By  David ConlinOct 23, 2003$(function(){$('#stars_67879056').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        I led the first two pitches of Werk Supp to the crux of MoD. This combo is stellar.  P2 of Werk Supp can be combined with this crux, although that may have been my downfall, as I was pumped by the time I got to the crux.   Tricky feet and crimpy hands up high. Used small nuts and Yellow and Green aliens (equiv. to BD 0.3, 0.2 I think), the latter of which held multiple lead falls before I figured out the sequence. My partner, Mike Flanagan flashed it though. The belay atop is weird. Sling a root, good BD #2, poor BD#3 (would have been better with bigger cam).




        By  Shane ZentnerFrom: ColoradoMay 23, 2004 rating:  5.10c 6b 20 VII 20 E2 5b$(function(){$('#stars_289844134').html(starsHtml(2, 'avg'));});


        The first and last pitches are good The last pitch takes small gear, i.e. blue Alien, #1 Metolius TCU and FCU, small stoppers.  My buddy built an anchor using medium cams downhill from the top of the last pitch.  The last pitch felt right at  5.10c.




        By  Jason ShatekApr 15, 2005


        Got spanked off of this climb yesterday, can anyone comment on where the 5.9 start is thats in the route description for P1?  I went up the brown band to the left to the left leaning crack but couldn't get a solid piece in so I ended up bailing out.  Whats the easiest variation on P1?  Is there really a 5.9 variation?




        By  Jason ShatekApr 27, 2005


        TR'd the first pitch yesterday, I tried several different variations to get ready to lead this thing.  I went from the left up the red rock band and from the right up a thin crack.  I also tried straight up but this was too tough.  However, the crux from whatever direction was moving onto the face with the left leaning crack.  If this is 5.9 then its the hardest 5.9 i've ever done!  I'd say the easiest variation on the first pitch goes at 10a with less than bomber protection right off the ground.  With that said its still a very fun route with some cool moves.




        By  Clint LocksFrom: BoulderJul 7, 2006


        Substitute P2 of Werk Supp, and you've got a great line! Regarding P3--stemming out left toward the top as soon as you can will ease the difficulty and keep it more in the .10c range. Also, do what you can to downclimb/rappel 'softly', so as not to add to the soil erosion on the descent line.

        The crux pitch is excellent - well worth doing. It is easier if you have small fingers.

        The last pitch is a great link up with the first two pitches of Werk Supp. It's pretty spicy near the top of the finger crack, but the gear is great so it is well protected. I followed this route a few weeks ago and wasn't too fond of it, but after leading it today, I realized how great this line actually is.

        Did Werks Supp to this gem. I thought it was a blast. Good pro, fun moves. I thought it was fair to grade at 10c but could agree with 10d.

        The offwidth (5.7) above the crux finger crack makes a great continuation to this climb. I didn't find the rope drag to be very bad. I didn't have any pieces bigger than a BD #1, but I was able to get in some gear on the face and sling a chockstone in the offwidth. There were plenty of face hold inside and outside the offwidth too.  Finishing MOD by climbing the offwidth corner to the top of the Bastille felt much more fulfilling to me, try it!

        Here's how this route breaks down:  P1: 5.9. Ascend the right side of MoD Buttress via the right of two cracks. Small pro until the hand crack is gained. Belay at chains. 75 ft. P2: 5.10a. Scramble through easy terrain to an obtuse corner. Finger-sized cams. Lieback, stem and reach right to gain the top of the corner. Head right slightly to belay below the diagonal crack. 125 ft. P3: 5.10c. Climb the crack! Excellent movement... too bad it's so short. Great pro. Belay at top of crack from a BOLT ANCHOR.   Descend to the east. 10min. back to base.  Good route.... Would definitely be best to link with Werk Supp for a great route.

        I really enjoyed all three pitches of this route!  It was the first time I've ever done the first two pitches, and while they don't warrant classic status, they've got some fun, thoughtful climbing on them.  The third pitch I hadn't climbed in more than 25 years, and it was as good as I remember!




        By  Kerr AdamsFrom: Albuquerque, NMJun 8, 2015


        Warmed up on the first pitch. There isn't much gear until after the crux. However I was able to wiggle in one of the smaller BD micronuts a little ways below the obvious wide spot in the thin crack. If you start on the far right, get to the good stance, and look around the corner, you can put in a blue TCU and extend it, then traverse left to the get to the sort of decent micronut placement. If you do slip at the crux and the nut comes out, you may just skim the ground instead of completely decking. This would also be nice for your follower, so they don't swing. Can't wait to go back and do the rest!




        By  mountainhickFrom: Black Hawk, COJun 17, 2015 rating:  5.10c 6b 20 VII 20 E2 5b$(function(){$('#stars_704199998').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Kerr, ditto Tony B above. 3 variations for P1 start, and if you want good pro, there are at at least 3 good placements on the left start before moving up into the left-leaning crack; a micronut then a TCU under the left-arcing overhang, then another good placement at the base of the crack itself before committing. If you start up and move right a little traversing across the 5.11 start, there's a great right kneebar to help you hang out to place and rest before the moves into the crack.  Bolt anchors at top of P3. No more need to build a weird gear anchor.

        P2 & 3 link nicely.  Fun climb.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Found and inspired by Chip Ruckgaber, Space is one of those routes that is very obvious once you look at it but it has been passed up by climbers for years.  It is the obvious, right-angling strata that begins about 20' up the third pitch of Wide Country and traverses all the way across the upper North Face until you can finish up Saturnalia.  Look on page 51 of the Levin guide and you'll see it.Location Approach via Wide Country or the Bastille Crack.  Set a gear belay at an old piton at the base of Wide Country's third pitch.  Head up Wide Country for about 20' (10c) to the beginning of the angling strata that shoots all the way across the upper North face.  Place gear high on Wide Country and head out onto the face toward a bolt on Hairstyles.  Continue the pumpy, rising traverse toward Outer Space (medium nut & 1.5" cam).  Cross Outer Space and continue toward Saturnalia.  Place a good 3" cam then head up Saturnalia.  Pumpy.  The crux is probably the section that crosses Hairstyles.Protection Standard Eldo rack.  Lots of long slings.  Consider bringing extra 0.5-2.5" cams if you place a lot of gear on the first 20' of Wide Country's  third pitch.  #4 cam could be useful, but not necessary.  Clip a bolt on Hairstyles as you cross that route.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Bold but not death defying for those comfortable with soloing 10a.  A coup in your belt for doing this one.  This route is included in Steve Levin's "Spice Tour" description, but because of its quality, deserves its very own entry.  Get to this climb by either climbing the first pitch of Wide Country, the first two pitches of XM, or the first pitch and 1/2 of the NW Corner.  If starting from XM, traverse right until you are on top of the NW Corner finger crack.  Clip a bolt off the belay ledge, but otherwise not much pro until you arrive here.    Head up and left to an undercling flake which you should lace with gear because that is going to be it for awhile.  Now up and slightly right on great edges but zero pro (10a) brings you to a short but welcome crack.  Watch out for the loose hold somewhere before you reach this crack.  Pulling this off would result in a nasty fall.  Stuff the crack with lots of cams of around 1" size.  The crux is a bit run-out too, but after the face climbing you just did, it feels pretty close.  A short, much easier & well protected dihedral lands you on the big ledge below the Outer Space headwall.  David A. TurnerProtection Standard Eldo rack (be sure to include one inch cams).

        I thought this was sufficiently terrifying - I was more scared than on Jules Verne at least.  The loose hold on the run out is a serious disaster waiting to happen.  The hardest move of the run out (the actual crux comes later and is well protected) comes right before this hold - both my partner and I latched onto it and moved up to a better stance on it, only feeling it flexing after the fact.  Someone please go up there and knock the thing off - preferably while seconding.  Also, Rossiter's topo is misleading on this climb for three reasons. First, if you start this from the anchors atop Wide Country, you traverse almost straight right past a bolt, not up into the 5.9 variation of XM as shown. Second, there isn't an 11a S move near the top of the NW Corner piton crack as shown. Third, the run out is definitely more serious than 9+ S as shown.  The climbing is pretty darn good though!  A long, sustained, and interesting pitch.

        While the runout is pretty serious, it is definitely more mental than really difficult.  I wouldn't say it was any harder than 10a.  Concerning the loose hold, it would be great if it was gone but I didn't feel like it was necessary to even go near it to finish the runout.  With that said... WOW, Holy Shit!  What an amazing pitch!

        I followed this climb with my friend Joe yesterday.  We were doing the "spice tour".  What an incredible pitch!  I agree with the other comments that it is BOLD, but not death defying.  Yes, there are some huge runouts, but on moderate rock.  Leaving the belay and traversing over to the pin on NW corner is probably the spookiest section.  Besides the bolt at the start, there is no pro for quite a ways.  The runout below the crux would be very spicy on the sharp end, and yes, the loose hold is still there.  It kinda caught me off guard.  The crux section has bombproof gear about at your feet and  it's really only a couple hard moves of 11.  I guess I'll be on the sharp end next time.  This climb should definitely be on every hardman/woman's ticklist.  4 STARS!!

        Back on this one again today with Joe.  I was on the sharp end this time.  I found myself with another case of "pastemouth" similar to last weekend on JV.  Good thing you're pulling the crux with great gear near by.  This climb is delicate and balancy is spots way out on marginal pro.  Classic hairshow!  Oh, I think the loose hold is gone.




        By  JelloJun 17, 2007


        On the first ascent of this pitch, I actually started from the second belay on XM, but instead of going straight right past a bolt, I followed the little arching corner up and right (part of the 5.9 XM variant Josh mentions above) and from its' end continued up and right across blank rock to meet the flake below the runout slab at its' bottom.  This makes a more independent and committing route than the one described, but overall about the same technical difficulty.  Rossiter's guide is correct.  Glad you guys are enjoying the climb.  -Jello

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This sensational pitch, formerly called Space Invaders II, parallels the last pitch of Outer Space, about 25 feet to the left.  The simplest and fastest approach is to get to the top of the third pitch of the Bastille Crack, belay, and then launch out right along the stratum (~20') to a short, left-facing dihedral.  A line of ring bolts straight up the steep wall above marks the route.  There are two hard sections separated by a good rest with a knee-lock.  The lower section (.11b/c) just gets you warmed up for the upper crux.  You'll execute a series of intricate moves in a short distance in order to set up for the balancy crux moves.  Look for a hidden pocket/dish and then make a couple of big moves to finish it off onto a flat ledge.  From here the route joins the original Space Invaders at .11a, past 3 more bolts (plus small gear) to the top. Concerning the rating, the Eldo guide calls the route .12c/d but nowhere is it any harder than .12b.  The crux is kind of involved but the moves are not hard 5.12.  Using Genesis (.12c) as a yardstick, H&A should be rated quite a bit easier.  Perhaps the stiff rating is more a result of the amazing exposure rather than the actual moves. One of the things that make this route so fun is that it is very well protected.  Combine that with its stunning setting and aesthetic positions, and you've got one of the best pitches in the canyon.  If you climb 5.12 and crave exposure, then this is a must-do route!Protection 10 bolts to a 2 bolt anchor.  Gear is needed for approach pitches.

        This route would see way more traffic if it had belay anchors. It's a total pain to rig a belay, unless both climbers climb 12b/c and the second can remove all the crap. A big loose rock is in the way of your feet at the belay as well. It would drop straight down Bastille Crack.




        By  Josh JanesGeneral AdminMar 18, 2009$(function(){$('#stars_291092520').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        I assume you mean the belay at the start of the pitch?  I seem to remember not having too much trouble finding gear there... but we always approached by rapping in from above and setting up the anchor at a natural starting point just up and left from one of the Bastille Crack belays.  When I was working this route, one of my partners, who will remain unnamed and happened to be wearing my bright orange down jacket, had to relieve himself while I was climbing.  Despite my protests he proceeded to urinate right into the Bastille Crack.  A few days later I walked into the BRC and a few staff members jokingly chided "way to go pissing all over the most popular climb in Boulder last weekend!"  "It wasn't me!  I swear!"




        By  Bart PaullFrom: Boulder, COApr 9, 2009


        A good way to set up for this route is to belay about one third of the way up the second pitch of Outer Space, below the start of the prominent dihedral.  This belay takes smallish gear, TCUs, nuts, etc.  From there, climb the dihedral on Outer Space with some long slings, and then cut left onto the bolts of Hairstyles and Attitudes.  Using this method you can take this pitch all the way to the top of the Bastille, and it's one of the best pitches in Eldo!

        FYI:  I obtained a permit to re-bolt this route (the old bolts will be removed and new 1/2" bolts as close as is safe to the old holes).  However, due to a little power drill drama last week there is currently only one new bolt at the top of the route.  Hopefully a new drill or battery pack will magically appear and the changing of the bolts may continue.

        Glad someone is replacing the bolts on this thing, those old ones are annoyingly hard to clip!   One question/concern though: I noticed there's a quicklink and rap ring on the new anchor bolt. Do you think the top anchor needs to be equipped for rapping? I can't really see any reason why you'd need to rap here, and if you're rapping in to approach the pitch, you can just hang a couple draws and retrieve them when you top out.  I guess my concern is that someone with limited knowledge of the route/area will see the anchors and attempt to rap down to the ground, which would be tough. I know the anchors are not super visible from the summit, so it probably won't be a problem, but there doesn't seem to be a reason for having them equipped for raps at all.  Again, thanks a ton for the volunteer work, I don't want to be negative, just thought I'd raise the question. -Scott

        Also, maybe replacing the bolts is not all that necessary... I went out today with my friend Matt and sent this route sans bolts, all gear. It's not really super runout, I did TR a few times first, but it could probably be done ground-up by a 5.12 climber. It actually felt easier this way, since you don't have to clip any bolts during the crux.  -Scott

        Hardcore F***n' Hardcore!  Nice work, Scott.

        I belayed Scott on the all gear send today, it was sick!! He ran it out 20 feet on a so so number 6... that's right, you heard me, he climbed that bitch with a number six swinging from his harness. Good work, Holmes.




        By  MadaleineFrom: Boulder, ColoradoJul 31, 2009


        This route has been equipped with new, 1/2" and 3 1/2" bolts.  Not all the old ring bolts have been removed, and will be within a month or so.  The bolts were replaced as they were first installed, with rap rings at the top and one new bolt at the belay from below.   *ALSO**, a new, bright yellow static rope is "MISSING."  I left it up there for over 2 weeks in the dark, deep recess/crack at the top-out.  pls. return this to the ranger station or email me. If it was stolen, WOW and good karma to you.....and it's actually a dynamic rope so you should go out and take some whippers.




        By  Blake CashFrom: Chattanooga, TNNov 10, 2009


        Thanks for all the hard work, Madaleine.  This is on my list of routes to do for the winter here in the FRange.  Karma will come around to whoever stole your rope.    So, there is a belay bolt for this thing?  If one were to rap down the route, it would be pretty obvious, yes?

        Yes, there's a bolt at the lower belay (the start of the pitch). It will be obvious rapping down. This would be a cold winter route, though, good luck. -Scott




        By  Adam ScheerMar 21, 2011


        This is a great climb that is now a little harder due to one less hold before the crux.  I pulled off a flake about a foot long and 4" wide from the rotten band.  Judging from the chalk, I wasn't the only one to be using this hold.  Establishing on the headwall below the crux is still in the realm of 5.11+, you may just need to figure out new beta.   	  	              	      	  	    I pulled off this bad boy from the rotten band a little above the kneebar rest.  The flake dangerously flexed when I used the crimp to help establish on the headwall before the crux.




        By  Brady RobinsonOct 8, 2012


        Thanks to 3 recent sorties by members of the Action Committee for Eldorado, all old ring bolts are now removed, holes are pretty well camouflaged. Also, rings were added to the anchor at the bottom just in case anyone were to rap from there. FYI, those old ring bolts are a pain to remove. A Dremel tool with lots of batteries and lots and lots of fiber cutting wheels was the ticket, much easier than a reciprocating saw or hand saw. Pulling them out by force seems like a bad idea - forces are great enough to damage the rock.  Big thanks to Madaleine for replacing the ring bolts. A multi-year team effort hopefully resulted in a pitch that gets more attention now. And now that Madame Guillotine's bolts have been replaced, the epic 5.12 link-up is ready for all suitors!

        Take care at the belay station below the climb.  There's a detached brick in the crack below and left of the anchors.  Your left foot and this doomstone will be playing footsy.  Excellent trundle candidate, but clear the road.




        By  Mike McHughApr 26, 2013


        Thanks to two brave souls from ACE, the footsy block has been gently lowered to the road.




        By  MontyAdministratorFrom: Golden, COAug 12, 2014 rating:  5.12 7b+ 27 VIII+ 26 E6 6b$(function(){$('#stars_393567573').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Now that the footsy block has been removed from the lower anchor (THANKS GUYS!), a decent stance can be made by placing a 0.4 size piece in the crack to the left of the anchor and clipping in short.  Thanks again to everyone who has helped rebolt, dremmel, and trundle, this is an awesome rock climb!

        Strayed onto this by accident with in 1975 with just a few stoppers and a novice partner belaying me, and it's the closest I've ever come to dying while climbing. Managed to get off of it alive, but just barely. Interesting and not surprising to see it didn't get done until 13 years later - definitely burly with some sketch pro.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description P1: Wide Country. Begin right of the Bastille Crack, at a shallow left-facing corner system.  Climb this (5.9) with thin but adequate gear, being mindful of a large semi-detached block 50 feet up.  Above this, at a bolt, climb up and left (crux, 5.11a if you have it wired), then back right to an obvious overlap (hand-sized cam) which you turn on the right, then up to the chain anchors at a nice stance (a 60m rope just makes it to the ground).    P2: XM to Outer Space.  From the belay stance, head up and slightly left, past a couple of fixed pins, to a short, steep wall where the seam fades (small RP here).  This is the traditional third pitch of XM.  Pull this move (5.10b R), and head up forty feet into the Outer Space dihedral (5.10a) and the large ledge below the headwall, and belay.  P3: Outer Space.  Now undercling up and left to the prominent crack system splitting the upper headwall (this is the last pitch of Outer Space).  Follow the crack as it zig-zags up, finally reaching the top at some solution pockets.Protection Standard Eldo bag-o-trix.

        I looked around for the initials on Outer Space today(4/18), but couldn't find them. I stopped and looked at every conceivable sloping stance where a hanging belay would be possible. Any hints, how big are they.




        By  Michael KomarnitskyFounding FatherFrom: Seattle, WAJan 1, 2001


        I love how some people, when adding routes, describe the pro.  Its not scary or poor protection - it's "exciting", or "a little spicy."  :-)

        The first pitch of this feels quite hard for .11a, very cool footwork intensive crux.




        By  Anonymous CowardAug 1, 2001


        For those who want to be more precise about their spice, the 10b crux on the second pitch is protected by the smallest rp I own.  Even with a screamer, I doubted it would hold.  The next piece down, a pin, is maybe 8-10 feet below your feet when you make the crux move.  Tom Isaacson




        By  Anonymous CowardMay 8, 2002


        I climbed this yesterday and was able to figure out the (yes, very footwork intensive - look around for awhile to find the key nubbin) 11a crux of the first pitch - but ended up falling three times on the 10c crux (you can see the huge shelf but how the heck do you reach it!) of the second pitch!  Maybe I just couldn't figure out the moves, but it seemed a degree of magnitude harder then the 11a crux.




        By  Bill WrightMay 9, 2002


        Nice job, AC, on figuring out the 11a face move. I've only followed this pitch once and I didn't figure it out. I think the runout above this move is horrendously scary looking. I need to follow this pitch once move before I'd lead it.  On the second pitch, the key is matching on a small, insecure hold up and right. You get it with your right hand first, then delicately step up and match - very insecure. This move is hard, but not as baffling as the move on the first pitch. At least for me. I've led this second pitch before and followed it and haven't fallen off this move. If you fell three times, it must have been a descent fall since the gear is well below your feet as you reach for this ledge. How'd the fall turnout? Did you fall on the fixed pin or put in a higher RP?




        By  Joe CollinsSep 23, 2002


        I did the first pitch of this (Wide Country) the other day and I have to say that the section past the bolt is one of the hardest low-11's I've done at Eldo.  The 10ish section above at the overlap is exciting.  The 'hand-sized cam' that protects this section is a bit sketchy as it is wedged against a loose block.  However, the block doesn't flex, nor does it look like it's going anywhere.  One can back this piece up with a bomber yellow alien up and left (if you are tall enough to reach the placement).  An awesome pitch!




        By  Anonymous CowardSep 26, 2002


        The Wide Country pitch would be 11d/12a as a Boulder Canyon sport climb

        2nd PITCH HAS LOST A FLAKE: Today (6/29/04), I fell about 15 feet above the belay on the 2nd pitch (variation to the right), and my two cams pulled off a medium-sized flake.  This was not the main undercling/lieback feature that you follow the the right, but a smaller undercling flake above the main one.  I don't believe it will affect the overall rating of the climb, as the route really goes to the right of the flake before traversing back left above it.  It does eliminate a couple of protection opportunities (which apparently weren't very good).  Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare.  The flake landed in his lap, and is now sitting fairly securely on the ledge up and left of the belay.  I'd hate to thing what would have happened if that sucker had fell to the road!

        The LK initial carving comment is truly interesting trivia. I'l have to figure out where ol' RB made his mark.

        Very entertaining and great clues, Steve!  Hopefully it will pique the curiosity of a new generation of Eldo history afficionados....but isnt the answer to the last clue a different climb, namely Rosy? I haven't seen the film in many years, but I seem to recal the incident that I think you're referring to occurring on the traverse.




        By  Greg HandFrom: Golden, CONov 16, 2004


        Here is the story as told by PA in High Over Boulder:"I was wearing a pair of big mountain boots which Cub Schaefer gave me to try out on rock. I was using a stretchy nylon rope I didn't trust, I was belayed by a 14 year old kid I wasn't sure could catch me, I had no chalk. I had to hammer in all the pitons climbers today have the benefit of clipping, and I managed to climb the 5.11 move my first try. Dalke told me he'd done the upper section of the dihedral free and that it wasn't much harder than 5.8. So when I got the hard moves, and as all of my assorted adversities began to wear me out, and giving myself the benefit of the doubt that I could--under normal circumstances--lead 5.8, I started resting on carabiners on relatively moderate moves. Perhaps I shouldn't have listed it as the ffa. When people complained that I had cheated or been dishonest or some such, I returned and climbed the pitch in much more exact style."  Also, Bob, I think you meant to type DH instead of DK.  The old days are fun to reminisce.  By the way, Steve, do you remember when and where we first met??




        By  Greg HandFrom: Golden, CONov 16, 2004


        Steve,  I was climbing at the Gunk's with Howard Doyle and we came across a crumpled mess at the base of Karma Sutra. I don't remember the date but I am sure you do.  Greg




        By  Bernard GillettNov 17, 2004


        "So anybody want to name the climb, and where the RB initials are located on the climb??"  Steve - isn't it on Vertigo, and the intials are at the belay below the direct finish roof?  That's where I see those initials in my mind's eye, anyway.  You can send me a bag of your left-over halloween candy for a prize if I got it correct  :-)




        By  Ivan RezuchaFrom: Fort Collins, COMay 8, 2005$(function(){$('#stars_1314816407').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        I first did the DNF around 1978 when I followed Rich Goldstone up it. Rich also led me up Rain which seemed pretty bold in that pre-cam period.  Did the first pitch yesterday in much worse style. The approach was fine. Lots of gear, but a bit dicey at the bottom. The crux was frustrating. It looks pretty easy, but the problem is, I think, the holds, although in reach, are in the wrong places and the balance and sequence are difficult. After a few falls and hangs, I tightened my shoes and did it, only to get pretty scared on the easier ground. Got a tiny brass high (that later fell out) and moved far left. Good gear the rest of the way. The 10 finish seemed straightforward. Strong winds and dropping temperatures convinced us to abandon our plan to continue to the top.  The crux is a bit problematic for the second because a fall swings you far left. Next time I'll climb double ropes (as I did this time) and after the crux not clip the right hand rope until the end of the 10 finish. This should provide a good TR for the second.




        By  superjoshAug 2, 2006


        This is far and away the best line I've done on the Bastille.  An elegant and sustained directissima.

        Very excellent route. The climbing is very continuous throughout all pitches with varying degrees of difficulty on all. Above the crux on P1 is pretty spicy! I balked numerous times over the course of many minutes but finally wiggled in a #2 BD stopper and 000 C3 and did the moves. Pretty decent distance above the pin without this gear.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description The only reason I give this 3 stars is because the line is disjunct and it doesn't really go anywhere.  However the climbing is excellent, certainly as good as many other 4 star routes.  The route starts near the NE corner of the Bastille, right off the road and about 50 feet east of the Bastille Crack.  Walk just past the first steep buttress (March of Dimes Buttress--about 50 feet high) that lies on the road, 100 yards or so west of the parking lot.  The route starts just right of a 40 foot, large rotten dihedral formed by the west edge of March of Dimes Buttress.  P1 - Climb up flakes either on the right or the left for 25 feet, and then lieback another shallow flake to a stance 50 feet up.  Follow a beautiful thin crack that jogs gently back and forth, sometimes taking the appearance of a shallow dihedral.  Belay from bolts on a sloping ledge about 140 feet up.  I recommend stepping left to the ledge 5 feet or so before the crack ends (especially if your second isn't solid--the bolts are not on top of the crack).  (5.8+)  P2 - Traverse 15 feet left across the ledge to an obvious, right leaning crack/slot (moving the belay if desired).  Climb that for 50 feet (crux, with perfect hand-jamming and awkward feet).  Belay on another large ledge.  Above is the beautiful 5.10c finger crack of March of Dimes; climb that, or traverse off east.  Be very careful on the descent; we got cliffed and ended up rappelling from a tree.  Possibly go quite a ways east.  Note: Many people do the fantastic first pitch, then rap from the bolts down and east to the top of March of Dimes buttress, where another bolt anchor exists allowing passage to the ground.  Easy to do with a 50 meter rope, and a great end of the day route.  If you have a 70m rope, you can rap all the way to the ground from the P1 bolts.Protection Rossiter suggests up to a #4 Friend, but the whole climb seemed well protected with nothing larger than a #3 (but bring at least 2 of those, and 2 # 2.5).  You could conceivably place a number 4 at the bottom of the crux pitch.  Bring lots of small gear for the first pitch.

        Yes, I made the same mistake on the descent too which made for some tangy downclimbing the steep slope with loose rocks. The correct or easier way is to stay high on the traverse until you see the talus field.   I found that many smaller pieces work best for the first pitch. My largest piece was a #2 Friend until the last move, where I placed a #3 Friend.   On a side note, Myke and I were filmed on this route today (4-30-01) for some climbing instruction program to be aired on a new cable network. We will probably get 5 sec. at the end when they are fading out. ;-)

        I did both pitches yesterday and I would have to say... the second pitch is VERY STRENUOUS, especially after doing such a long pitch before it.  Absolutely a 9+, if you are not comfortable climbing 9's then don't try it unless you got doubles in the #1 and 2 Camalots.  I also found this climb to be VERY odd from the usual Eldo climbing style.  I can't wait till I have more time to try the next section of March of Dimes (10c)... what a cool lookin' crack.




        By  Erik CorkranJun 12, 2001


        Somehow I never realized that there were bolts on top of the first pitch.  Always did the long runner and belay at base of P2, as someone mentioned.  This is a great route, though personally I don't like the first pitch very well (the 2nd one makes up for it though).




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 13, 2001


        Really??  Wow!  I think the first pitch is one of the best 5.8 pitches in the canyon--I've done it about half a dozen times.  Great for running up at the end of the day.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        Linking this route with the last pitch of March of Dimes is great, and it makes the descent much easier.  Even though pitch two was short, I found myself placing more gear than I usually would only because the ramp on which the belayer sits angles up right quite steeply.  Resultingly, in the the event of a fall, hitting this ledge is quite likely if the leader has run it out at all.  9+ is a good grade for this pitch, but the 10c March of Dimes pitch is a bit overgraded (more like a/b) especially when compared with routes like Bolting for Glory (10a) and Northcutt Start (10d).

        An Awesome line.. A little bit of everything, jamfest on P2, good fingers on P1, great length on P1. A really superb route. Good grading as well, P2 deserves more credit than it gets, it is a character builder once you get on it. Jump in !!




        By  Aaron ShuppJan 24, 2002


        If you like big cracks, P2 is great.  I haven't found anything quite like it in Eldo.  Eventhough P1 covers some discontinous features, the line is very enjoyable with good quality rock.  I highly recomend it.




        By  Hayden YurkanisMay 31, 2002


        Did the first pitch today...you can sling a horn right when the real climbing begins for good, easy pro (not the two obvious horns below it). An all around 3 star pitch--and long.




        By  Chris ChlebowskiJun 14, 2002


        The first pitch is easily one of the nicest pieces of rock I have EVER been on. Gorgeous line, good pro and astheitcally pleasing. Climb this thing. I think it deserves three stars:)

        I agree with everyone, the first pitch is a really great climb.  The pitch is varied, interesting and fairly sustained.  The protection at the bottom of the route looked a little bit sketchy, although I didn't lead the route.  But I thought the harder, upper moves were well protected.  I really look forwared to leading this pitch.  I think the first pitch is rated 8+ in Rossiter's guide, and I would say that's right on.

        .... there are many flakes to hang a rope on, not to mention the rocks perched on top of P1 March of Dimes.  I'm sure it is possible to rap directly from the anchors atop P1 Werk Supp, but doing it in 2 shorter raps significantly reduces the chance of something going wrong.




        By  Dr. DanFrom: Steamboat Springs, COJul 1, 2003


        Before I led P2 I was given some beta on gear, which included taking a couple of Metolius #3s and a #4.  The only gear I used, and felt very secure, were #1s and #2s.  It is not actually an off-width, but a solid, be it awkward, hand crack.  Because of the right leaning and downward direction of the crack, it leaves your body hanging and your right foot smearing most of the way.




        By  Shane ZentnerFrom: ColoradoJul 7, 2003$(function(){$('#stars_342337534').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        I didn't place anything bigger than a #3 Camalot near the crux(the offwidth is too flared for anything bigger.) Solid at the grade and burly.  Laybacking caused me to barndoor and fall several times. Maybe a combination of jamming and laybacking would work.  Well worth the effort and fun to do.




        By  Hayden YurkanisJul 17, 2003


        The second pitch, although shorter, is much sweeter than the first...very physical hand jamming, don't rappel after the first pitch!! Crack climbers will eat this pitch alive.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoJul 24, 2003


        Small cams will sew this up...good stems, jams, and laybacks on P1.  Pretty sustained for (8) climbing...thoughtful moves in a few setions, but its all there.  A great, long, worthy first pitch...looking forward to continuing up P2 in the near future.

        Pitch 1 has got to be my favorite 5.8 pitch in the whole canyon.  Climbed it at lunch today and we were the only climbers on the Bastille.  If this isn't 4 stars, I'm not sure what is!

        I led this route and finished with March of Dimes yesterday. All 3 pitches are stellar, in my opinion.  P1: sustained 8+, very enjoyable, a little runout after the first piece. Bring plenty of small-medium cams (i.e. 0.2-0.75 Camalot equivs.) and larger nuts. Definitely belay from below P2, rather than at the bolt anchor.  P2: I loved this pitch and felt more secure on it than on P1. I don't know what the + is doing in the rating. Maybe it is hand-size dependent, but I didn't find this particularly hard, and it is short. There are good feet on the right face and in the crack and the hand jams are bomber. I would say 5.9, no plus. It is easy to continue onto March of Dimes without stopping for a belay, although this may have been my downfall (I fell on the 10c crux) as I was kind of pumped after the first two pitches. May have benifitted from a rest before tackling MoD. Gear: I placed Camalots 4, 0.5, 3, 2, 1 BUT I think a 4 is unnecessary and a 3 would have been better in that placement.  P3: (March of Dimes) Hard, for me anyway. Tricky feet and crimpy hands up high. Used small nuts and Yellow and Green aliens (equiv. to BD 0.3, 0.2 I think), the latter of which held multiple lead falls before I figured out the sequence. My partner, Mike Flanagan flashed it though. The belay atop is weird. Sling a root, good BD #2, poor BD#3 (would have been better with bigger cam).

        Trail another rope or use it for double rope gear (better idea) and you can rap to the ground from the chains ten feet east of the ledge you end up on after pitch one.   Was going to aid this today but we had a nice break in the cold snap and it went On Sight free on lead. I placed enough gear for aid (double ropes) should my girlfriend need it, but she toughed it out. REALLY classic first pitch. I'd do this three or four times a year for a quick run up a fun yet challenging route, especially if the Bast. Crack  is a traffic jam. Easy climbing lets you top off the beast after pitch one anyway...   For gear, double up on nuts #7-9, double green Aliens-2" cams. For an anchor on a direct line with the first pitch, bring a pink tri-cam #9 BD stopper, and appropriate cams. You can set up an equalized anchor in the wide finger slot just after the cruxy overhang with accompanying finger-tip crack. If you're bailing after this, belay down to the chains and rap directly to the base. OR simul the rest of the broken ramp to top out the rock quickly.  Can't wait for the warm weather!~Wm

        Goodness...Concerning the gear on this route, I recommended WAY too much. Doubling cams from green Aliens-2" is insane considering the weight you're carrying. Remember that I set enough gear for AID. This is when double ropes are recommended, NOT for a free ascent. This is not an Indian Creek varying crack, so don't gear up for that. Just bring a standard Eldo rack (but include some small cams and hexes. They will help). Thanks Leo. ~Wm

        I recently climbed Werk Supp again. This time around I used left hand crimpers on the face and jammed with my right hand in the crack (laybacking will make you barndoor). Look for the rail near top left of the crack. Led the last pitch of March of Dimes from here-medium stopper, blue Alien, green Alien, blue Metolius.

        I got to lead P1 for the first time today and found it to be exceptionally good. I ran out of the right size nuts towards the top. I can't honestly say what else could make this pitch better! It certainly deserves 3 stars.

        I vote (it's that time of year) for 5.9 on the second pitch.  It's short but good stances to place pro above the offwidth are not there, and the climbing is sustained.

        Climbed P1 today -- I thought the 5.8+ rating was right on.  Beautiful sustained climbing with plenty of gear placement opportunities.  We took 2 full sets of aliens and I used everyone along with 13 runners and various other pieces.  Big gear is good to use in the first 30 feet but not a requirement.  Also, a 60m rope for rappel gets you to about 10 feet off the ground to an easy down climb.  I placed a perfect red Alien right in the crux but also found that I needed that hand hold.  Next time I would use a stopper or something.  Great route!




        By  Anonymous CowardJan 1, 2005


        Sure.  From the top of WS pitch one (the lovely finger crack), cruise easily up the ramp to the right and enter a short but awkward dihedral (5.6; may be a fixed pin here).  You will arrive at the belay on top of BC pitch 3.

        Larry,   I've done this a few times and it links up fine.  There is one tricky and awkward 5.8ish spot with poor pro (an old pin, I think) and quite a bit of loose rock but it goes...    The second pitch of WS gears up very well and is short.  Go for it... when you're ready...

        Since a rappel on a 60m rope will get you down within 10 feet of the ground with stretch, it's obviously not at 140-150 ft. pitch. I'd put it closer to 105 ft. Vertical distances are usually overestimated.




        By  Anonymous CowardApr 26, 2005


        Larry, I think the ramp from the top of P1 on Werk Supp to the P2/P3 pitch of the Bastille Crack goes at 5.8ish if you stay to the left its 5.6ish with crappy pro if you go to the right its 5.8ish with better pro and an old pin at the crux; I think the route is called "Shatek's Ramp-age."

        Named by Ament because the climb works up (i.e. wers up) in difficulty the higher you go.  Find an old copy of High Over Boulder to read Pat's comments.

        My .02 cents - p1 is great fun, a perfect challenge for anyone comfortable on 5.8ish routes. Several thought provoking sections between good stances. I was glad to have lots of small gear, I used all of it. First 30' or so has kinda sketchy pro, after that it's solid.

        This is a great climb and well worth doing. Pitch one and two could not be more different. Pitch one is thoughtful and balence-oriented while pitch two is deep-set slammer hands. For what it's worth, P2 [reminded] me of [Pool of Blood]. For the walk-off: head east down a ramp system, you'll see a tree with slings-don't go there, instead climb up a short corner and then down a very easy ramp to the talus.

        This would be a **** route if there was some kind of fixed anchor either atop the 10c March o' Dimes pitch, or above p2 of Werksupp.  Summitting above here takes a lot of time and walking, the "East Face" isn't fun to descend either.

        I followed pitch one and I thought it was quite interesting and somewhat typical Eldo style with traversing and steep face with the occasional crack feature for gear and what not.  Pretty sporty; sustained and a bit bold, I don't think I would have enjoyed to lead it.    P2. Was mine and I was a bit nervous with anticipation of the awkward looking crack but also eager to get on it and learn something.  I got up and placed 2 cams and got pretty pumped trying to see how to get up the akward section onto the stance in the first pod, I came off and grabbed a cam to keep from decking as my belayer was back at the chains of pitch 1 and there would have been a bit of rope stretch.    I lowered to the ground and started again after looking it over a bit.  I got into the first rest stance in the pod and got some more gear, and kept working the hands/ wide hands crack through the pods getting gear and an awkward rest occasionally.  I plugged a #1 near what seemed the crux and ran it out to the ledge with the tree on the far side.  Both I and my partner found this to be stout for the grade and definitely sustained for the short pitch it was.  The thing seems to want to spit you out the whole time, and there isn't much out side of the crack to keep you in so you just have to work the jambs, keep moving and keep an eye out for holds on either side of the crack when the going gets rough.   We took MOD for the third pitch and both had some trouble with it seems stout to me, bout as hard as Northcutt Start on BC for sure IMO. We continued up the OW directly above and over to the last pitch of BC, good fun! Pretty sure I used my 3.5 and #4 on p2. and my partner wanted the #4 on the OW above the finger crack on MOD.

        Fantastic; in all honestly the first pitch my be my favorite trad line anywhere; fantastic, varied, and sustained climbing makes this a classic moderate.  Just when things start to feel a little hairy one of the magic "wrap your hand around" flakes of a bomber finger jam appears.  Eat's TCUs and C3s for breakfast.  We found with a 70m rope and some rope management [read: long slings] you can get to the top of the Bastille via the end of Bastille Crack from the Werk Supp PI anchors in one pitch, which makes for a great afternoon jaunt if time is scarce.

        I just did pitch 1 for an end of the day climb and found it to be fantastic and varied. I was in the midst of it, 90 feet up, and remembered why I love rock climbing so much. It is thoughtful, balancy, and simply sweet! Or maybe I just love finger cracks. Eats up nut placements.

        I just don't know. I floated the crux pitch of Handcracker Direct, which is supposedly a 5.10a handcrack. Then I jump on the second pitch of this, a 5.9ish hand crack. Which one should be harder? I guess I really suck at crack climbing....sometimes.

        Beta question for P1.    Whenever I see people leading this, their first piece appears to be about 20-25 feet above the ground.   Why?  Is there no gear before then?   Is the rock just not worth placing gear in?  If so, then what would you rate the difficulty of the first section of the climb before the finger crack.  Despite the fact there is no "R" rating on this climb, I am leary to lead it because I am not a fan of routes that have no pro near the ground.  Although that is a common characteristic for Eldo routes :-).  Any thoughts would be welcome.  Regards,  Drew

        Drew, in my experience (have led pitch 1 3 times that I can think of), I've found the climbing up to the finger crack to be much easier than the rest of the route, maybe 5.7, climbing is on big holds.  Much of the initial section is expando rock and some people might not bother to place gear but there are some decent possibilities.  I seem to remember a good pin or 2 that also inspired some confidence.  The pro at the crux is bomber and I don't feel the R rating is warranted.  Just my 2 cents though.

        Thanks, David.  That's all I needed to go fire it up this morning.    I led both pitches.  I was able to get some "okay" gear in before the pin.   The pin is not really needed, but I clipped it anyway.   Super fun and intricate moves in the finger crack.     I ended up peeling off on P2 after pulling out of the funky pod half way up the pitch.  Then finished it off clean.  I would recommend 2 #1 Camalots for the P2 hand crack.   Also bring a #2, a #3 and leave the #4 at home (or use it for the P2 belay).  What a classic route!  Get on it if you have not yet :)  Drew

         The first time I did this route was in 1979, back then I could not afford cams. Didn't trust them either, they were new and looked unreliable. Hey, I was climbing trad, my shoes were PAs if anybody remembers them.   P1 was wonderful, sustianed but not too difficult. P2 was a bit more commited. I was able to get a #8 hex in at the "slot". I did not trust it but continued on anyway. Ten feet above it I peeled! Falling head over heels backwards, chalk raining down like snow. My belayer held me two feet above the belay ledge!  The #8 hex held!! I could not believe it! So I smoked a ciggarette to calm the nerves and made it on my second try. I love that climb!

        About the rating: Pat Ament, Rossiter, and Levin's guides all give P2 a 9+ (Ament did the FA). To the extent that any climb actually has a rating, Werk Supp does, and it's 9+, not 9. If it feels easier than 9+, congratulations, you're climbing well.

        I did just the first pitch today as a last climb before heading home.  I loved the climbing!  I wish I had brought more small gear (BD #0-0.2) as the finger crack at the top of the climb was more challenging with just placing nuts.  I used up my smaller gear lower on the climb.  Although a #4 is not necessary, I did place one toward the bottom of the climb.  I rapped from the bolts using a 70 meter rope and got to the ground with very little to spare.  You NEED a 70m to do this!

        As per the above: to rap to the ground from there, yes, you need a 70m. However, you can rap the route with a 50m if you go to the station to climber's left on top of the March Of Dimes pillar as described in the topos and this route description.

        P2 is a little slice of Vedauwoo in Eldo, super rad hand jams all the way, some big, some small, I think the crux could be almost anywhere on the route depending on your hand size.

        Replaced the Werk Supp anchor early this morning. It had 3/8" x 3" carbon stud bolts that were getting rusty. Now it has 1/2" x 4.75" SS 5-piece bolts with SS hangers. I put the old chains back on, but plan to upgrade those to SS also soon.




        By  Kyle PJun 8, 2015


        Thanks, Gregger for the chains, much appreciated. Just a short PSA in regard to rappelling Werk Supp: if rapping the route with a 70m rope or double ropes from the top of pitch 1 (i.e. in one rap), please be sure to rap directly over the top of the March of Dimes buttress. You will rap directly over the chains on top of pitch 1 of MoD. Do NOT descend via the gully between MoD and Werk Supp. That gully is stacked with large, loose boulders. When dislodged, those boulders will find their way to the base of Werk Supp (where there is often a belayer) and/or into the road. We were unfortunate enough to be at the base when a climber chose the loose gully and kicked loose a microwave size block, which triggered several other large rocks to tumble down to the road. No one was hurt, but it was a good reminder: 1) to always wear a helmet everywhere in eldo 2) that even 2 minutes from the car, there are loose rocks on routes/raps that see enormous traffic.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Who knows who really did this first. How many variations are there????? I stumbled onto this a while back...Do WC through its crux to the stance. Immediately move up and right to near the top of a blunt arete (separates WC and the scoop of TS). At this point you will be above the crux (and 1st bolt) of Times Square and able to reach right to clip TS's 2nd (and last) bolt. From this point continue up to the shared, standard finish. Protection WC rack recommendation plus QD for last bolt on TS.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is a serious lead and even more serious for the second. Let me jump ahead to the crux second pitch. The second pitch contains a 20+' traverse after the crux. To protect your second consider a) double ropes, b) solo the pitch, c) rappel and clean the gear, d) have the best climber follow the pitch and hope they don't come off.  Start about 20' right of the start of the Bastille Crack, 10' left of the cave at the base of the Bastille.  P1. Climb up through a series of runout, left-facing dihedrals (7 vs) to an ramping left facing corner. This section contains three pitons of marginal to poor quality, it is very easy to back these up. Continue up the hand crack (10b) and move right at a piton. At this point you're stepping into the base of the detached X-M pinnacle. Grovel up the chimney to the bolted belay on the top of the X-M pinnacle.  P2. From the bolts move back left and down to the left most edge of the X-M pinnacle. Place small wires (RPs) as best you can here. Step onto the left side of the arete and make the crux face moves. The crux is relatively short, then you have 10-15 of 5.9 traversing before you reach easier ground and gear possibilities. Rossiter shows a pin on the topo, but I did not see it. At a shallow, right-facing corner, continue up easier terrain to a bolted belay (watch for bird poop here).  P3. You can either climb up and left or out easier terrain to the right. I lead the right hand variation. From the belay climb up, clip a piton and hand-traverse left. Mantel up on the narrow ledge. From here I continued up to the base of the 10b section of Outer Space.  Rossiter describes a different finish, but continuing onto Outer Space provides a great linkup.Protection Rack up to a #2.5 Friend, RPs.

        Have not done this route, but I distinctly remember a Bill Wright TR where he describes falling on the P2 crux as the second climber, and not swinging at all.  His partner, he said, was able to creatively place a stopper back right after the crux.  Unfortunately this TR was only on my e-mail inbox and somehow got deleted...it isn't on Bill's website.  Anybody familiar with this?




        By  Anonymous CowardAug 1, 2001


        I did not see any nut placements out right post-crux.  I have led and followed the second pitch and found it scarier to follow.  If the second is really worried, it's not that hard to tie off short, use the extra rope to thread the anchor atop pitch one and give yourself a back belay (probably easier with a grigri).  It's the same idea as lowering yourself out from an anchor on an aid route.  Tom Isaacson




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COAug 1, 2001 rating:  5.10c 6b 20 VII 20 E2 5b$(function(){$('#stars_602172026').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        There are 2 possible brass-nut placements just around the corner from the flake-belay. I used 2 HB micronuts (not offsets) These can be placed from a good (not pumpy) stance at the corner if you can do a near-splits (or are very tall, which I am not) or from a slightly off-balance stance once arount the corner on the face holds.  A few more things- yes, the old KB's on Pitch 3 will hold a 30' fall. That was me on Sunday. It might be a little harder in the heat/sun. Do it before the sun hits in if on a summer afternoon.  The route should get 2*'s. Great route, but not the best.




        By  Kristo torgersenAug 1, 2001


        for pitch 2, the climbing becomes easy after the crux, and so if the stronger climber is leading, it would be advised to run it to the belay or as far as he/she finds comfortable.  this will make the swing of the second less substantial (more like a toprope than traverse) and will make it easy to get back on the route after the fall.  even better, climb the route with two solid 5.10 leaders, no falls, no worries.




        By  Bill WrightSep 13, 2001


        As Charles states above, it is quite possible to place good gear for the second on the 2nd pitch. After completing the crux, climb up and set left a few feet to a good stance. From here it isn't hard to reach back to the right and place good gear directly above the crux. The second is completely safe now. I did indeed fall off while following the crux. I went only a couple feet to the left and was able to get back on and do the crux the second time. My advice on the crux - step onto the wall as low as possible. Once that is done, heading up involves only a single hard move.




        By  Anonymous CowardNov 1, 2001


        If you don't have HB's there is a really solid #3 Black Diamond Micro Stopper (steel-head) in the seam at the crux.  Reach up high and slide it down until it catches.




        By  steve dieckhoffNov 1, 2001


        On P2 the leader can back-clean even to the point of  clipping the anchor and downclimbing the easy  dihedral....after that it's fairly easy to climb out right from  the belay and clip into the bolt on INNER SPACE (the  only real use for that bolt)--this will give the second a  good toprope. They take a little swing but it's not as bad  as they think it'll be.    On P3-the left-hand var.--I usually place a very small  but solid RP next to the crux 'long reach' move. It goes  into a perfect little slot formed on one side by a crystal.  After the long reach it's nice to get a good piece in and I  think the best might be a tri-cam!

        I must say that this route deserves atleast two stars.  Good rock, good moves, good line.  Plus if you combine it with Outer Space, it's one of the most fun/best 5.10's in the canyon if not the front range.

        TWO STARS!!!....




        By  Quinn StevensFrom: Denver, COMar 23, 2002


        If the first two pitches are lead together, then it is definately scarier and more dangerous to be on lead during the crux.  I followed the pitch, thank god, and pulled the crux moves before cleaning the disturbing RP.  I'm fairly confident that had I fallen during the crux, the rp would have kept me from the big swing.  However, the above advice for the leader to reach back right, following the traverse, and placing something for the second is good.  It's impressive to link pitches 1 and 2 together, climbing directly into the crux from the chimney.




        By  Joe CollinsJul 25, 2002$(function(){$('#stars_399463115').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        X-M__Outer Space is one of the best 5.10 routes I've done in Colorado, along with the Scenic Cruise, Yellow Wall/Forrest Finish, and the Book link-ups at Lumpy.  As stated above you can get two RP placements right at the crux, but it takes some work to find the optimal placements.  The nuts are decent, that is they'll probably protect the crux but I certainly wouldn't want to take a big winger (or an 8 footer for that matter) on them. Be solid!! If the leader fires the crux then he/she should have no trouble finsihing the pitch without placing any more gear. The leader can then clip the Inner Space bolt to protect the 2nd as stated above.




        By  Bill WrightJul 25, 2002


        I just noticed that this route has only one star. Bogus! Two stars at least when you combine it with Outer Space.  As stated above, if you combine the first two pitches, it appears to be quite dangerous for the leader. Also, as stated above this route is NOT dangerous for the second even if the leader fails to place the stopper above the crux as indicated above.  Here's the new information. If not combining the second pitch with the first there is a good way to protect the leader. The belayer clips into the bolts at the top of the pillar with a long length of rope and climbs back down to just above and right of the crux moves. Braced in the slot by the pillar and the wall, the belay can now give the leader nearly a toprope for the crux moves! In fact, I wouldn't even bother placing the RP's - the belayer is above you. If you step out low (tricky and balancy), then there is a single hard move to do.

        Hey Bill-  isn't that the wussy way of doing it?... just kidding.  That actually seems like really good beta for those who want to do the route but might not be the most solid at the grade.  I have heard of people linking the first 2 pitches, but clipping the chains for crux pro... big, big swing potential.  FYI- I think linking the 1st and 2nd pitches is actually much safer than belaying at the chains on top of the pinnacle.  A belay from the chains would likely put an outward force on the delicately placed RPs at the crux, possibly pulling them out.  With the rope running straight down the RPs are more likely to stay put... as it is, the highest RP pulled on me anyway as I did the easy traverse part. That next piece of gear sure is a long way below the RPs though.




        By  Bill WrightJul 26, 2002


        Joe,  I guess it is the wimpy way, but the way you describe leading it (linking the pitches without using the belay anchor), the risk is way too high for someone like myself. I have also heard of people linking the pitches, but clipping the chains with many long slings. Seems like too much hassle to me and your method (of just using the RP's with the next piece way below that) is just too dangerous for me. Hats off to the guys like yourself who have the mental control for such feats!  I should probably also say that I haven't even led the pitch in question! I have belayed two people using this method, though. I need to go lead it. I followed it fine the last time up there.  Bill




        By  Brad BondJul 26, 2002


        If you're gripped about the nut on top of the flake, string additional runners over to the two-bolt anchor to back it up -- the nut would keep you from swinging inside the flake if the micronuts were to fail.   I think it's better to lead this way because if you were to fall on the micronuts, the catch would be very dynamic and they are more likely to hold. If you belay, you're looking at an awkward pull on the nuts as Joe desribes or placing nothing -- either way, a nasty fall for both the leader and belayer.




        By  Bill WrightAug 30, 2002


        I just led the 2nd pitch this morning and I didn't place any RP's at the start of the route. With the belayer positioned correctly, this feels quite safe. Don't fall after the crux move, of course, but then it is easy. Place the stopper underneath the small flake - tricky to find and place because it isn't obvious, but it's there.  I led the third pitch as well and after clipping the three fixed pins, you can place what appears to be a very solid #2 steel RP (might be a #1 - anywhere a really small nut). This placement is not immediately obvious as there are to other placements that are larger, but not very secure and I doubt would hold a fall. This tiny RP doesn't inspire much confidence, but if it held, this pitch would be well protected. If you fell and it pulled, that would be bad, as the pins are well below your feet the crux move.  Great climb!  Bill




        By  Brad BondAug 30, 2002


        That is a sneaky little #2 RP placement on the third pitch! I once managed to slip off after the crux and fell about 10 feet onto it and it held. Glad I didn't find out what woulda happened if it didn't. Scary.

        Three stars when combined with Outer Space.  The first pitch (10b) is a quality stop on the Bastille 1-pitch cragging tour.




        By  Doug RedoshFrom: Anchorage, AlaskaMay 18, 2003


        if you are tall, like me, the crux could be the move out of the handcrack on P1. The crux moves on P2 are tricky to figure out, but once you work on it, it's not that bad (fortunately for me, my partner's gear popped after he passed it, giving me an effective toprope).  The crux on P3 is a reach problem, but not pumpy, like on P1.Don't make the mistake, like we did, of thinking that you can downclimb the ramp to the left from the top of P3.  This led to some rappelling in the dark!




        By  Anonymous CowardMay 19, 2003


        From ramp at top of pitch 3 climb around the corner right to the easy (5.0) exit pitch for W. Butt, Hair City, etc.  Takes about 2 minutes to the top.

        This is one the best multi pitch 5.10's in Eldo when combined with Outer Space.  When done in 3 pitches,  every pitch is 10c and every belay ledge is great.  It has a little bit of every type of climbing that Eldo has to offer.  (squeeze chimney,  liebacks, technical face, steep cracks, mantels, runout face, and overhanging jug pulls)

        Unsure of whose advice to heed regarding linking P1 and P2, I used double ropes with one rope clipped with a long sling to the bolts above the pillar, and the other rope going straight up to the brass nuts. This worked pretty well, but I had a lot of drag trying to rock over onto my left foot after the crux. That was pretty tenuous. With double ropes you can just run the right rope straight up from the P2 crux to the bolt right of the belay that  Steve Dieckhoff mentions above. Looks like a big Crack'n Up will go in above the higher brass nut. Next time...  I actually had more trouble on P1. The first 25' or so are really slick and no gear for a while (but I placed a piece high on Wide Country, and then pulled the rope through after getting gear on route). The moves leading to the step across are awkward. At the step across it's reallly pumpy. I hesitated at the step across, put in a cam above the last pin. Downclimbed about 10'. Tried to rest, went back up, then had to hang.  On P3, the 9 way makes the most sense to me and is the original aid route. It's straight up above the belay, and the gear is good until the hand traverse. But beware!  I followed this pitch, and a small Alien was really stuck. Chuck said, "Maybe the flake expanded when I leaned out on it." Sure enough, I used my nut tool as a mini crowbar, and I could visibly expand the flake (not the smartest thing to do, as I was hanging on another cam in the same flake while working on the stuck cam).  After cleaning the gear, I downclimbed the 9 variation and TR'd the 10 variation on the left. Didn't see that trick wire. Had to pop for the ledge. May not be leading that variation any time soon.

        I really wanted to do the original 4th pitch rather than finishing on Outer Space, although Outer Space sure looked tempting.  We had neglected to read the guidebook, but I knew it went up a dihedral right of Outer Space. I thought it was the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral, but my 1980 Erickson and Ament guides now make it pretty clear that it's the green dihedral much further right.  And that is what we climbed. From the belay above P3, climb up about 20' to where Outer Space traverses in from the left. Move right on the red band to below a small dihedral with 3 pins. I thought I was going to climb this up to the dihedral just right of Outer Space, but it looked way hard. Continue right to a tenuous stance. I had a real hard time here letting go with either hand, but eventually got gear. Make one more hard move up and right to better holds and easier climbing. Continue right to the base of a left facing dihedral with a good crack (finally!). Thinking I was home free, I was surprised to find a hard move half way up the dihedral. The crack runs out, and I had to step left onto a sloped hold on the arete with not much for the hands. One more hard move back right into the corner, and easier climbing to the top.  Erickson says this of the pitch: "Move up a little and angle 30' right, then climb a dihedral . 5.9". Felt harder, 10a S? Ament says, "...with marginal protection traverse right (5.9) across a steep band of rock. Ascend a left-facing dihedral 5.8 [felt much harder to me] near the west edge of the wall. Rossiter's topo looks correct but his text makes the rightward traverse sound short.  Questions: What's the dihedral just right of the Outer Space dihedral? Below that dihedral, what's the dihedral with the 3 pins a short ways right on the XM traverse? Just right and up from those 3 pins is a left facing flake with a pin. What's that? There are lots of routes and variations on this wall. It's hard to figure it all out.

        Here's another testimonial for the quality of the small RP on the 10c variation to the 3rd pitch, and the insecurity of the move.  No need to risk a 25 footer... my foot slipped off the mantle and the RP held... basically a 5 foot fall.  The move isn't that hard, but you mantle with your weight fully on a polished, slanting hold... a strange, insecure move.  Look around for the placement... it isn't immediately obvious, but it's there.

        FLAKE ON P3 HAS MOVED!  Today (6/20/04), I fell on the right-hand/straight-up variation on P3, pulling two cams and the flake under which I had placed them.  This is the flake that Ivan Rezucha mentioned on 5/16/04 as being loose.  I'm not sure how this has affected the rating on this pitch, as we bailed and did not finish the pitch.  The flake is now sitting (marked "XXX" with chalk) fairly securely on the ledge just up and left of the belay ledge Fortunately, my partner and I only suffered minor abrasions and a good scare, and the flake landed in his lap.  I'd hate to think what would have happened if the flake had fallen to the base...




        By  Steve OrrJun 30, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_374238192').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        WRONG FLAKE!  In my previous posting, I said that the flake I blew was the same that Ivan mentioned above.  The flake that blew was NOT the hand-traverse flake, but a much smaller undercling flake about 10 feet directly above the belay.

        This is a "heady" route!! Awesome rock and cool moves. My partner led p1&2 together which seemed pretty bold.  I was pretty worried about the big swing following the moves off the pillar. For p3 I tried to go up the left var. but backed off, gear wasn't great, and I couldn't find anything that would keep me off the ledge. so, I went up the right side. All was well, I got to the base of the O.S. dihedral and kept moving right.  I clipped a pin (shoulda clipped two) and started the looong upward traverse right.  I got a ways past tht old janky slightly downward driven pin (about 10-12ft out) and lost a foot on some lichen.  This sent me for a freaking long ass ride!!! We guestimated about 30-35ft!! By far the longest fall I've taken! If that pin pulled it would've added another 30ft to that (my last piece was a good 15ft below).  I finished the pitch but still found no other gear 'til the dihedral.  A lot of lichen and not much chalk tells me most people don't do this pitch. It's a scary pitch I think but well worth doing, and it is part of the original climb.  Outer Face is aloso a good exit option if you don't want to do O.S. again or if someone is on it.




        By  Wyatt PayneFrom: Littleton COAug 12, 2007$(function(){$('#stars_808630784').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        Link P1 and P2.  You can use a cordalette to clip the anchors above the pillar just like it was a long draw.  This allows the leader to fall straight down on the nuts if they slime off, and if they do fail you won't take the full ride b/c you will hit the bolts.  when I lead it I didn't have anything long enough to pull off this trick.  So I had my belayer up on the pillar.  That situation would have pulled the nuts around the corner hard to the right if I lost it.  Not confidence inspiring. In fact I wouldn't put a rice cake on them if they pulled into that orientation.  Have fun.

        After contemplating the crux move on p2 for a good twenty minutes I ended up committing to the higher variation with two tiny sidepulls.  Either way, it's one move that is quite exciting.  The RPs there are mental gear.




        By  mike cFrom: goldenJan 17, 2010


        Let's not kid ourselves. In the description, it is written that this climb is a more serious for the second when in fact I have seen many climbers fall from the crux and just swing left 15 feet or so. Yes, I assume it is a little scary to fall from there as a seconding climber. If the leader were to fall and his little manky stopper actaully hold, they'd hit the edge of the big old flake/chimney and it could be nasty, and if for some reason that piece failed they might never walk again.... So, I don't agree that it is more dangerous for the second. I do think that if you do X-M to Outerspace in 3 pitches, it's one of the best 5.10s in the canyon, if not the best.




        By  IanFrom: Boulder, COAug 7, 2010


        Linked the first two pitches, which made sense to me at the time, because if the micro nut blows at the crux, you'd fall down instead of swinging onto the bolted anchor and the pillar. Of course, you're likely to fall further, but I didn't test the theory. The swing is not a big deal for the follower if you place a nut loosely after the traverse. Everything will pull out when you move up and you can claim that you soloed the second pitch. :)




        By  WallyFrom: DenverSep 2, 2011


        Mike C. is totally spot on. The second pitch is very serious for the leader - with bad fall potential (suspect RPs with a bad landing if they blow). A ballsy lead. If the second blows the crux, no big deal - a top roped swing to the left with nothing to hit - I've had two seconds take this fall - they were able to swing back into the start and try again. The suggestion to solo or backclean the pitch doesn't make any sense (i.e. is crazy) to me.  Wally




        By  Max JosephFrom: Boulder, COJul 5, 2012


        Wow, I'm surprised to see almost no mention of the offwidth variation (original free variation?) to the first pitch. The way most of you guys are going sounds a bit hairball. Got up there the other day and it was great! Pretty secure and featured, while still physical. The chockstone seems like it's not going anywhere, and if you want to you could potentially bring a big cam to push through the crux. Doesn't seem to get a ton of traffic, but I'd recommend it for a bit of old school fun.




        By  michalmAug 10, 2016


        The tat around the chockstone at the bottom of the Dalke offwidth will hold a fall. A few months ago, I led the offwidth after clipping the chockstone tat with a sling. After feeling a bit insecure due to grease and funky beta, I started to downclimb from 25-30 feet above the chockstone. I was unable to downclimb the entire way and ended up taking a 40-footer onto the tat and ending up eerily close to the ground. I then grabbed a #6 Camalot and reclimbed the pitch clean. Someone might want to tie some new cord there sometime soon, but it is good enough for now.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description One of the beauties of climbing on the north side of the Bastille is the ability to combine pitches from neighboring routes, in effect selecting the "tour" you want to climb.  One such excursion, dubbed "The Spice Tour", takes on several runout, serious pitches which together form a cohesive climb.    Begin with "Interceptor" (5.11b PG-13), a beautiful pitch of face climbing which heads straight up from the "direct start" to XM, on the north side of the Bastille between Wide Country and the Northwest Corner.  A moderate, runout section leads to the crack-flake (fixed pins) just left of the obvious offwidth start to XM.  Place gear as high as possible in the flake, and when it ends punch straight up onto the blank slab (a green Alien can be placed before the hard move).  Have a long runner handy to wrap a flake for pro on the 5.10 slab.  Now climb easily to the chain anchors at a small stance (the top of Wide Country P1, and XM P2).    Pitch two climbs "Inner Space" 5.11b R/X.  Head out right from the belay past a superfluous bolt, to a corner (directly above the crux of the NW Corner) and climb up and left to a left-leaning flake overlap.  Place gear, then runout 25 feet on thin face (5.10a X) to a bulge with a seam-crack in it (good pro).  Now climb a short, difficult 5.11b section, and climb straight up the crack (5.9, you are now on upper XM) to the large ledge at the base of the upper Bastille headwall (below the last pitch of Outer Space).    Pitch three climbs "Saturnalia", 5.11b PG, an exciting direct finish on the headwall.  Climb a short but unprotected 5.8 section on slopey jugs (watch loose rock) to a bolt.  Make a difficult pull, then up and slightly left to a second bolt.  Climb the short, left-facing corner directly above the bolt (5.11b) to a hollow-sounding flake system which leads up, slightly left, then back right to the top.  A direct finish, climbing out right from the flakes, has been toproped, but so far (to my knowledge) has not been led (5.11c or d).    There, you've done "The Spice Tour".Protection Standard Eldo rack, with RPs, Aliens to a 2.5" cam.

        Wow!  Got on this wild route recently and we completed the first 2 pitches (ran out of time to do the 3rd).  Although I got scared and backed off the 1st pitch, it wasn't too bad in retrospect, with pro at your feet during the crux moves (the green Alien), then much easier moves to the flake pro mentioned above.  The next pitch (Inner Space) was much scarier, real glad I wasn't leading that!  The crux felt very technical, even for Eldo, and I would rate it 11c.... at least the pro there was reasonable, pretty good gear at your feet as you start the hard moves.  The dihedral above that was very funky and awkward and felt like solid 5.10, but the pro here was decent.  The quality is absolutely excellent throughout, funny how some of the best routes in Eldo are the spiciest!




        By  Rob KepleyFrom: Westminster,COMay 27, 2006 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_381512862').html(starsHtml(5, 'avg'));});


        An outstanding link-up!  Climbed this today with my bro Joe.  I got Interceptor and Saturnalia, he sent Inner Space.  Interceptor is such a classic pitch.  Just keep it together, the run-out is not too bad.  I followed Inner Space after this.  This is one fantastic journey up the Bastille.  It wasn't quite as desperate as I thought it would be.  All the really big run-outs are on moderate rock.  I think the spookiest part on lead would be getting over to the top of the Northwest Corner.  There is absolutely no pro in this section.  The crux is protected with bomber pro at your feet.  Saturnalia was a good pitch.  It sorta wanders a bit.  Totally out of character with the previous two pitches.  All in all, The Spice Tour is great climb.

        Well.... That was exciting.  The Spice Tour is a great way to feel born again through rock climbing.  Interceptor is on the soft side of R but really really good and perhaps the difficulty crux.  Saturnalia will feel like piss by the time you get there.  Really the crux of this worthy linkup comes down to the aptly named Inner Space pitch.  I was definitely finding my inner happy place up there.  I would call Inner Space R/X serious and a big step up from Jules Verne.  If you came off at the end of the run out... well... I can't imagine anything good would come of it.  Maybe after your 70 foot slab slapping whipper you'd be fine, but if I were a betting man, I'd put money on broken sticks.  I actually found the "10a" runout to be quite stout, technical, insecure and improbable, and the rock is a little friable, but if you are solid on 5.11 and have a cool head, it should be fine.  A good attention to detail is imperative.  If you read this in the next couple days... now is a good time to go do it, because with chalk on the route, I think it's a little less daunting.  Be prepared to clean lichen off the foot holds right at the point of no return crux about 15 or so feet into the run out! By the time you get the bomber pro before the "crux", you will not be afraid to climb 5.11 with gear at your feet!  I'm truly in awe that Jeff Lowe and John Baldwin, who I believe did the FA of Inner Space, had such big balls and technical climbing ability back in 1978.  Those guys were Heroes.  A route like this would be pretty forgettable with two bolts in the run out, but as it stands... I think you'd be hard pressed to forget this one.  Climbs like this remind me why I love climbing.  Get on it, it's awesome!




        By  Steve SangdahlFrom: eldo sprngs,coOct 27, 2014


        Cedar, Nicely done! John Baldwin and myself watched you lead the Inner Space part of this the other day. We were the clowns yellin' at ya to go right when you were lookin' left.  Having led Inner Space 4 times myself, it was great to watch someone else on it from across the creek. Puts the run out into a new perspective. As you know from the point of no return till you "finally" get to the bomber stopper placement is a defining moment in yer Eldoexperience as in "thank God or whoever"! Rarely gets done...imagine that. John Baldwin always reminds me that Jeff Lowe wanted to call it the Giraffe's Neck, as in ya gotta stick your neck out!  Nice send. Peace. Steve Sangdahl P.S. We call the Intercepter to Innerspace link up Interspace.

        Wow! Inner Space is really what it comes down to. I got the onsight yesterday after fearing it for so many years. It has quite a reputation. My thoughts on it: there are two scary parts 1) from the belay to the Northwest Corner 2) from that flake to the 5.11 crux. This route is a big step up from Jules Verne. There was a lot of lichen, but it never really got in the way. If you're confident and know you WON'T fall on 5.10, then go for it. In the end, it wasn't as bad as I envisioned, but it's still a serious pitch. Where falling on some parts would land you in the hospital, or worse. Great climb!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This is my favorite route on the Bastille. The last pitch is steep and one of the most spectacular pitches in Eldo.  Begin with the first pitch of the Bastille Crack to the belay below the 5.7 second pitch. From this belay, traverse right around a bulge to directly below an obvious, chalked dihedral. Do a sketchy .9+ move to get to a rest at the base of this dihedral. Next, clip a pin and climb the steep dihedral via stems and good jams (.10a), once at the top, traverse right on a ledge to a belay at the base of the crux undercling section. For the crux, place a good, small stopper before stepping off the ledge, and climb over dicey terrain to an undercling hold with a pin in it. Clip this pin, and use the undercling to move left around a corner (crux) and move up the crack system for 60 feet. This crack has many 5.9-5.9+ sections between good rests, the exposure on this pitch is incredible.  Follow the crack left to a short juggy wall and top out on the top of the Bastille. Protection Rossiter gives this route a runout rating. I found it to be pretty well protected and safe.  Some small nuts can protect the move before the crux (where you clip a pin).

        I found the crux pitch to be easier than the dihedral. Knock off about 3 letter grades if you're tall.




        By  Andrew WellmanJan 1, 2001


        This route is [unbelievable]. It is [definitely] the best route I have climbed at Eldo. [Rossiter's] book gives it and "s" rating, and this can be interpreted as "a 15 foot traverse to the left, that if [your] pro pulled during a fall, or while trying to clip the pin, would [deposit] you [...10 feet up?] onto a ledge." This one gets an "s" for the same reason Rosy Crucifixion does, a fall at the beginning might be interesting. I just wanted to clarify this [because] you never know. If you have looked at this route all spring, like I have, and not gone up and done it yet, go for it, its not too dangerous. The airy positions are killer, too.




        By  David BensonMay 30, 2001


        The final pitch is most definitely NOT S. I place three good nuts before clipping the pin in the undercling. And thinking the S section might be coming later I sewed up the rest of the route.  I also believe the first pitch (10b) to be more technical than the last pitch (rated 10c). The last pitch is long and somewhat pumpy, but probably more like 10a/b than 10c.




        By  Anonymous CowardJul 23, 2001


        Linking these two pitches with the first three of X-M makes an excellent and airy route.  With three pitches at 10c and two at 10b, and four of them with s or vs grades, it makes for an aesthetic and rewarding line straight up the middle of the Bastille.




        By  Joe HugginsFrom: Grand JunctionOct 15, 2001


        I led the whole thing barefoot many years ago, does that mean I'm a real stud? Anyway, the picture actually shows the upper part of Wide Country to the right of the dihedral.




        By  Andrew KleinDec 31, 2001


        Be careful not to go up the thin crack on the first Outer Space pitch to get into the dihedral.  There is/was a ripped wired nut in this crack.  Stay right and do a blind traverse to get into the dihedral. The last pitch is airy, well-protected (small alliens, nuts) and perhaps even a little easier then other Eldo 10c's.




        By  Tony CappaMay 6, 2002


        This route is absolutely excellent.  I recommend it to anyone interested in getting some big air out under your feet.  I agree with everyone else's comments that the first pitch of Outer Space is tougher than the the second.  That dihedral is definitely more technical and devious than the one hard move to clip the pin in the undercling on the airy final pitch.  Also, I second that motion to go around toward the right on the mini-pillar from the belay atop the first pitch of the Bastille Crack instead of trying to go up and over it.  This is one of the best I've done so far (which isn't saying much but), launch yourself into Outer Space!  The cracks and huecos toward the very top are so fun!  Take care for rope drag as you are topping out.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 12, 2002


        Great route!  I too struggled with rope drag at the top of the last pitch even though I put long runners on everything below the roof.  When I got home I looked in my old Erickson guidebook and he splits the last pitch into two, adding a belay after the roof undercling and initial steep flake (40' off ledge.)  Next time I do the route I'll try it this way.

        A fantastic route!!  Definitely three stars!  As mentioned above, I could not see how it got an S rating.  The climb, and the crux, eats up stoppers.  Even the somewhat dubious looking fixed pin at the crux (pounded straight up into a slightly flaring crack) could be backed up with a large tcu, although I'm sure that pin has held its share of falls.  As for the short bulge that can be avoided on the first pitch, I would be curious to know whether it was on the original line of ascent or not.  It offers another short section of technical 5.10- moves, is well protected and fun, but can be easily avoided by climbing down and around it.  Booty/Fixed Gear Alert!  One of the stoppers just before the crux on the second (10c) pitch, was so good that my partner was unable to clean it.  He could get the nut to move in the crack, but couldn't get it out of the rock.  He said his last attempt to free it left it pointing upwards, but believed if a leader clipped a draw on it and tugged downwards, it would seat well into its original position.  I hope that it is removable or at least becomes a good fixed piece.  If someone posts that it is neither, I will go back up on a fixed line and see if I can get it out so that it doesn't detract from this classic line.

        Just climbed this line again (4th time) after 3 years away from it. For the "s" pitch I placed a pretty solid #4 BD stopper just before leaving the belay (while still standing on the ledge). After 2 moves I put in a PERFECT green Alien up and right a few feet from the stopper. 2 moves later there was a yellow alien placement staring me in the face in a left hand sidepull... then the #8 stopper to the left, then up to the TCU placement beside the pin and the pin. Then around the corner to tons of gear opportunity.  In short, the climb is not S at all, unless S stands for "S"ewn-up. As for the difficulty, I too find the dihedral pitch more technical than the upper pitch and would give both 10a/b. Staying low on the upper pitch is the key, reaching the undercling by the pin from below instead of traversing over to it.




        By  Dan RussellMay 8, 2003


        There's also a billion Lowe-ball placements if you've got 'em, like every route in Eldo.  There are precious few "real" runouts left in Eldo with modern gear.




        By  Lindsay GillJun 18, 2003


        I followed this climb for the 2nd time yesterday and was reminded of how beautiful the line truly is.  The 1st pitch has wonderful stemming and finger locks and a very spicy second pitch with great exposure!One of my favorite in the canyon.




        By  Jim CollinsOct 4, 2003


        GEAR beta: On the headwall pitch, bring a Yellow Camalot for the start of the traverse off the belay ledge. You can reach way up and right to plug in the yellow camalot before beginning the traverse section.  Also on the headwall pitch, bring lots (10 to 12) of extra runners to minimize rope drag.  Finally, be SURE to look down at the Bastille Crack as soon as you finish the opening traverse.  It looks like a sidewalk, and makes the whole adventure fun.




        By  Anonymous CowardAug 31, 2004


        I've heard that when this and a lot of other Eldo "S" routes were put up, Aliens and small nuts had not yet been invented, hence the rating.  I agree the crux of the 1st pitch felt harder than the second. Of course I lead P1 and got a ride on P2. For me, the crux on P2 was getting into the undercling, once you are there,pulling around the corner was no problem.  The pitch is definitely not over though with several 5.9 moves left but all well protected with good feet everywhere. Enjoy. Best route I've done in Eldo!!!

        I just thought I would throw out the suggestion to start with the Northcutt start and it makes for three great .10 pitches in a row.

        Stellar route! Followed 2 & 3 today and found it to be every bit as good as advertised.   On P2 the first hard move up and over the blocky prow is made easier using the overhead rail as the crack up and over peters out. This rail is slopey in the middle, but pretty good low and higher up...there is a fixed stopper at the top of the crack. The next hard move for me was out from under a pod like stance at the start of the dihedral below the pin, using bomber underclings and the crack out on the left face to begin the business of stemming.  This move is 10b and leads to sinker fingers above and good holds up high to the ramp.  Suppose if you don't like big exposure the start of P3 might scare you, but the holds are not too bad working up & over to the undercling crux move.  Mostly smearing for the feet here, there are a few small edges, and a pretty good jug around the corner to start the business on this pitch.  Pretty sustained  (9) moves, with lots of exposure, bring you to a tricky, somewhat greasy, (8+) move up and left past the last  pin.  Juggy huecos to the top ended my new favorite climb on the Bastille.




        By  Mike McKinnonFrom: Golden, COJun 30, 2006


        I climbed this last night for the 3rd time and just wanted to add a more recent comment. Like everyone has said, what a great route.   p1 - Bastille Crack to ledge p2 - Chalked-up dihedral. There are three pins you can clip in this dihedral. 2 seemed bomber to me and the other one was decent. The hard part is getting situated in the dihedral. Once in the dihedral you can stem your way up using little hands. p3- Like everyone else has said, this is not run out at all. After pulling the 10c move, the upper part is pumpy and tricky. Counting the pin at the crux, there are three pins on this pitch as well. Only the last one looked like it belonged in the Eldo hall of fame.

        Such a sweet route! I don't consider myself a solid 10c climber and pulled this clean on lead after following it once. Not runout. If you are even close to the grade, Do This Route!




        By  TBlomNov 11, 2006


        Not 10c, not runout but very good and worth checking it out, maybe 10a/b.

        Alright, I have to admit to it and fess up.  I pulled the first piton thru the crux dihedral on the first pitch.  How one might ask?  I would love to tell a story of some great whip I took on this piton but actually, (sigh), I fell following this pitch mantling onto the sloping ledge off that horrible rail that looks great.  Yes, shameful I know.  I didn't play around with it, but I think you can get a small Alien where the piton once was.  Thanks to John for hauling me up this beauty and making it look casual.

        I climbed Outer Space again on 9/15.  I hadn't seen the above comment regarding the pin, so I was surprised when it wasn't there.  I was able to place a good nut AND a good yellow Alien within a foot of each other where the pin used to be, so I don't think it need to be replaced.  I will bring this up with the Eldo FHRC.




        By  SCherryFrom: San Diego, CASep 24, 2007


        Climbed this route in the afternoon on 9/23 for the 2nd time.  The pin is indeed missing from the start of the corner on the first pitch.  I was surprised to not find in there as I had remembered being able to clip it from the no-hands, shoulder-bar rest.  I am only 5'8" and was able to reach high and place a great wire to protect the crux move getting established in the corner.  No need to replace the pin in my opinion.




        By  Shawn MitchellFrom: BroomfieldAug 9, 2008


        Followed Shane Zentner today. Agree it's superb; agree the 1st pitch is trickier than the 2nd. But I think the 2nd still is the harder of the two and the crux was the marathon after the undercling/corner, which only felt about 10(a). The miles of 9+ pack a 10b/c pump factor, IMO. Good lead, Shane!  One other thought: On approach, it's not hard to stretch the  Bastille pitches across the traverse, past the little pillar, and belay directly under the dihedral. You can sling a couple flakes and get some small gear at the belay.

        I protected the opening moves of the last pitch with a red Metolius Astro nut, a green Alien, then clipped the pin. The remaining pitch was incredible and steep with multiple 5.9+ sections. There is a small, sloping ledge about half way through the pitch that offers a chance to 'rest', though I found it difficult to rest there.  The exposure, steepness, and awesome views of the canyon took my breath away.

        I climbed this today for the first time and have to agree with everyone that it is one of Eldo's best. I really don't climb S or R routes and the only reason I did was because of the comments here, so thanks everyone. I will agree the first pitch of Outer Space is the more difficult of the two. If I relate the dihedral to another classic, Over The Hill, the Outer Space dihedral is easier but still a handful and the exposure is no comparison. I am also comforted on OTH by all those pins...or is it discomforted on this one by the need to think a bit more. I'll chime a 10a.  Pitch 2 was relatively trivial, protects well, and is spectacular. I did not find a move harder than 5.9 on the pitch. With plenty of feet on the traverse and easy climbing around the corner I couldn't even tell where the crux was supposed to be. I thought it might have been a less secure leftward traverse near the end of the climb?  Overall, a fantastic climb with absolutely no R sections and plenty of rests if you want them.

        The pin protecting the chimney section at the beginning of the final dihedral on P1 is gone (or at least I could've sworn it was there before). You can get in a #4 BD nut and a pink tricam (neither of which felt bomber) before taking off. Fortunately, you can get gear soon after.  The high traverse on P1 is significantly harder than going low and contains the (5.10c) crux move of the whole climb IMHO.

        A wonderful route as advertised.  It protects *very* well.... and most definitely does NOT warrant an R rating.  You can place gear anywhere you want it (perhaps with the exception of the last 30 feet up the huecos on P2, but the climbing is easy).  I thought P1 contained the crux, and the stemming felt about 10a/b (and a touch easier than Over The Hill).  If there was a pin at the base of the stemming (in the chimney like alcove), it is gone now.... but a red alien fit nicely.  The P2 "crux" felt about 10a as well, but the entire second pitch is definitely a journey. I placed the EXACT gear Tony B lists above, and they are all bomber.  There are plenty of rests up the final headwall, but the various moves are engaging and sometimes a bit tricky.  I had pretty bad rope drag, despite judicious use of slings, so I'm not sure how I could have avoided it.  The pitch is spectacular, but the rope drag is a big bummer.  A standard rack (nuts and two sets of cams from tiny to #3 camalot) is fine.  Lots of slings.    Edit: I just looked at a photo and saw one of someone belaying under the "end" of the traverse, and that looks like the ticket to avoiding rope drag. My belay was towards the beginning of the traverse.  YMMV

        I agree with Tony both that the top and bottom pitches are about equivalent in difficulty, and that the gear placements do not warrant an S rating.  I will say however that the gear on the P2 traverse is strenuous to place.  I was only able to get a small nut and a yellow tcu before clipping the pin and giving it a go around the corner.  Once I got around the corner, I was expecting the climb to let up a bit, but a number of 5.9 moves awaited me before I found a substantial rest stance.  Great climb!

        Definitely in Eldo's Top 10, no top five routes.  Everything about it is great!  Great gear, great positioning, vertical, comfortable belay ledges, exposure, and so on....

        This route is junk.  My partner and I did it this past weekend in near-freezing temps wearing shoes that Chinese-foot-binding specialists would have deemed torturous;  we went without water, food, or warm clothing.  To say it went easily would be an understatement, but frankly, a couple times my feet were so cold I could have sworn my name was Hugh Herr.  All the beta is total crap.  There is no exposure . . . no pumpy headwall . . . no airy traverse.  There was some rather lackluster graffiti we noticed (LK who?), which I took the time to chip off and replace with a nice (and obviously more gratifying) "Eat Me" in bright orange spray paint.  I always huff the orange stuff on routes.  It just gets me there faster . . . .




        By  Mitch MusciFrom: Estes Park, COJun 8, 2011


        For the P2 crux, there's no need to undercling high by the pin. Just stay lower on better hand holds.

        CLASSIC! I have wanted to do this route since I moved to CO a couple of years ago. However, that R rating like many others has scared me away. This route definitely does not need an R rating. You can, and I did, staple the route up, hahaha! This fact does not take away from the exposure. The last pitch is amazingly exposed and awesome. I feel like the crux is short, but there is still some great moves to come to finish the route. I can't wait to run up this again, and I am psyched for anyone who has been scared off this thing to give it a shot. Great climbing.




        By  Alan DoakFrom: boulder, coAug 12, 2013


        It sounds like I was off-route on pitch one. I followed the chalk into the first corner with the ripped nut. I moved out onto the left face of the corner, using the thin finger rail, before crossing back right. It went, but it was harder than 9+, and I was a bit above my last piece by the time I was on top of the block. I'd be curious to hear what people rate it.

        Spectacular position and interesting climbing.  The first pitch is insecure and sustained at 10a for a good 20-30 feet.  I think the traditional "S" rating comes from this pitch, as you have to climb 8-10 feet above a small wired nut and risk a ledgefall.  I followed both pitches, so take this in context, but to me the second pitch does seem to protect surprisingly well.

        Wonderful route!  I didn't find it R, maybe PG-13 going around the first bulge P1 traversing to the corner, and on the P2 upper hueco-ed runout to the top, but neither sections are near the crux 5.10b-ish grade. Pro seemed plentiful and solid otherwise.  Don't let your guard down after pulling through the P2 crux. It stays pretty continuous and has a couple more interesting cruxy bits on the upper headwall.

        This route deserves all the hype it gets. First time up, we brought a single rack thinking it would be casual 5.10, and I used all my finger-sized cams early on the first pitch... made the crux dihedral very exciting climbing 15 feet above a small wire. The first time I ever got on this thing I ripped what my partner said was a super old and crucial RP fixed in the middle of the first crux of the first pitch. Sorry! First moves at the beginning of the second pitch are classic Eldo: if you do it right, it is laughably easy and if you do it wrong it is insecure and weirdly strenuous. Good on you if you can remember all of the beta from memory on the second pitch every time! I invariably have to climb up and down and up and down a couple times remembering the perfect way to do the several tricky sections of that final second pitch. Substitute Wide Country for the Bastille approach pitch with a bizarre intermediate leftward hand traverse in between (R-ish) for full value!

        Third pitch is basically a sport climb. Fixed pins abound! Only placed a red C3 on the traverse and a couple finger-sized pieces on some of the 5.9 sections before the juggy face. Great climbing nonetheless!

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Outer Face may not be worth doing on its own, but it really is the natural finish pitch to the classic Northwest Corner.  The business of the Northwest Corner finishes up on the big Outer Space ledge.  Instead of heading around the corner here, continue straight up on humungous jugs and slightly rotten rock - this is very steep and a lot of fun.  Above here you continue up a crack to a ledge below a slab.  Place gear at your feet and then head up the slab to an obvious undercling and gear placement (Yellow Alien).  Falling on this slab would land you on the ledge ten feet below, but it's only 8+/9- and fairly secure.  A difficult move up past the undercling brings you to a stance where you can get some decent gear.  Head straight up and over the (hard 5.10 move on lichen, gear below your feet), or traverse right (5.9 good gear) and up to the top of the belay.Protection Aliens are helpful.  There are some short runouts above ledges.

        ...The step-across onto the undercling flake can be protected by a 3.5 friend placed to the right in a funky heuco. The placement is hard to see at first but it's actually pretty good.

        When I climbed this, it was as a finish to the Northwest Corner.  My partner had led the last pitch of the Northwest Corner and continued past the Outer Space ledge up to the ledge below the slab, and set a belay there.  It made a lot of sense to do it that way.  While the slab section is short, it was nice to be belayed when my belayer could see me, as it does get a little thin and a fall could result in hitting the ledge below the slab.

        This is a great pitch. Not quite as exposed as Outer Space, less awkward and no pigeon shit. Worth doing again. The first half of the pitch is only 5.8 but fun with decent gear to be found amongst the choss. Rock gets very solid for the exit of the first overhanging bit with more decent gear just above. The most dangerous part is stepping over to place a piece in the undercling, a 5.9 friction move. Brad's beta for the big cam is spot on with the placement at waist level a few feet to the side. The crux is on amazing Bastille rock with good pro through it and after. Tried the left finish which has a couple of holds leading into it and then nothing but lichen. I ended up going right around the final overhang, better pro and easier.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description One of the most classic climbs in the country, it begins right off the road on the Bastille, a 350' cliff on the left as you enter the canyon. Often crowded, a weekday is probably the best time to attempt this climb.    The climb is north facing and in the shade until mid-afternoon.  As Jim Erickson said in his classic 1980 Rocky Heights guidebook, "avoid it like the plague if the weather is not warm, or you will shiver away much of its charm."  Start at the center of the north face of the Bastille, below a hand crack that starts 20' up the wall, with a huge, serrated flake to its right.  The first pitch has been the site of numerous accidents, so make sure you're solid on 5.7 crack climbing and placing pro before attempting to lead it.  P1. 5.7, 60'.  Climb up to the flake and step left to the crack. Jam or layback up the polished crack (crux), then follow the crack up and left to a small stance at a 2-bolt anchor with chains.  You can belay here (if you want to watch/coach your second through the crux), or continue with the second pitch.  P2. 5.6, 90'.  Climb up to the chimney left of the bolts, and step left onto the face.  Climb up to a finger crack, then traverse right above a little roof (crux). Continue up steep, enjoyable cracks and angle up left on easy ground to a sloping ledge by a steep wall.  Belay at a crack with a fixed pin.  If this belay is occupied, it's possible to belay about 20' lower at another stance.  Variation: near the top of P2, take a right-angling wide crack up and back left, 5.8.  Bring a big cam (#4 Camalot) to protect this line.  P1 & P2 can be combined with a 50m rope.  P3. 5.7, 50'. Climb up into a pod, then work up past a small roof (crux).  Continue up the cracks to another sloping ledge.  A #1 and #2 Camalot are useful for the belay anchor.  P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin.  Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux).  Go all the way left to a hand crack and climb it to a corner.  Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.  Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.  P5.  Several options here:  a. Easy finish: 5.4, 60'.  Climb the chimney to the top.  b. Fun finish: 5.8, 80'. Climb up a ramp right of the chimney to a huge corner with a wide crack. Climb up the face left of the corner to a fixed pin. Continue up the steep headwall and surmount a little roof at the top (crux). If you have a #3 and #4 Camalot, you can belay just above the roof (and watch/coach your second at the crux roof), otherwise continue up an easy gully and belay from a spike of rock at the top.  c. Grovel finish: 5.7, 80'.  Climb the wide crack in the corner just right of the previous variation.  To descend: follow deep grooves to the south until you reach a dirt trail. Go 30' right (west) and  then follow the marked Bastille descent trail north and down to the road at the base of the cliff.   (Ed. Note: beginner leaders--make sure you're solid on crack techique before trying this one. Placing gear is not trivial for the inexperienced.)Protection Standard rack to #3 Camalot.    Bring a #4 Camalot if you want to do the 5.8 variation on the second pitch, or if you want to belay just above the roof on the 5.8 variation on the last pitch.

        A Black Diamond OZ quickdraw was dropped on the 4th pitch and is probably laying near the belay station. Had to get my friend to the airport, so we weren't able to lower down to retrieve it. If you find it, please hit me up beer and/or good climbing karma will be rewarded! jdrich79@yahoo.com

        Note that it is possible to combine the first 3 pitches with a 60m rope, and one can combine the last 2 pitches even with a 50m rope (but watch out for rope drag).




        By  Matt BaumanJan 1, 2001


        I agree with George (by the way, your site is one of my faves George), the slick beginning of the crack seemed harder than 5.7 (Id say 7+). Also, a GREAT variation to the final pitch (avoiding the easy chimney) is to step right and head for the HUGE left facing dihedral with a wide crack....climb wide crack for ~10 feet and then take finger crack that angles up and left, becomes straight up and then opens to hands as it angles back right to the top of the dihedral.....GREAT 5.8 finish to this classic climb.




        By  T. MainoFrom: Denver, COJan 1, 2001


        Best 5.7 around. It seems 5.7 to me... but then I've done it about 100 times. Great tip on the variation up top... thanks.




        By  Derek LawrenceFrom: BaileyJan 1, 2001


        This route was originally rated 5.6 in the old Ament guide. I won't say it's that easy but if you stem between the crack and the edge of the flake to the right and than cross left at the top it's much easier than 5.8. Done this way the crux actually seems to be 3rd short pitch.




        By  Chris FisherJun 13, 2001


        I agree with the 5.7 rating.  The only way I could see the first pitch being 5.8 is if you don't have a long reach. Those of us 6 foot or better do have an advantage. I've done it several times as it is one of my favorites.  I also agree with the third pitch around the double cracks being more difficult than the first pitch, but only for a few moves.




        By  Paul GiglioJul 28, 2001


        If you think wider is better, try doing the "move left down the ledge and go up a corner system" pitch one pitch too soon (where you're clearly supposed to do the finger crack).  You'll soon find yourself in a short awkward flared chimney with a piton near the top that exits onto the ledge just below the normal P4 anchor.  Probably 7+ or 8 compared with some of the chimneys at Lumpy.

        Casey Bernal - Although it should be obvious, I thought it must be said here too. Most of the guidebooks state explicitly to place pro in the flake and crack in P1 before stepping into them. There have been several ground falls here. This is one of the most spectacular 5.7 climbs around. Enjoy.




        By  Michael KomarnitskyFounding FatherFrom: Seattle, WAOct 24, 2001


        On the photo, the short traverse out right on P2 I believe is 5.8, though I could be wrong - when I've done the route, I've continued up and slightly left following easy climbing instead of going right around that flake.




        By  Hayden YurkanisNov 6, 2001


        Alright, I will put my two cents in on the rating---5.7. In my HUMBLE opinion, it isn't 5.8 or 7+.  Also I didn't find it to be that slick and the feet were solid. cheers

        This is a good place to sit in the shade and watch all the beginner epics. "well protected 5.7+ crack - I can do that - I once led a 5.9 in the gym with no falls". In case there is not enough amusement with the Bastille Crack you can also watch the antics on Werk Supp. Apparently, this is a good place to toprope (either the Bastille, Northcutt, Werk Supp, March of Dimes, etc) because it seems everyday someone is blocking the upper pitches with a beginner toprope session.  While you might find this amusing to watch be sure to stand back because at least one gumby will drop something or pull on a loose rock. It can even be exciting (or horrifying) to watch as the beginners sketch out because the crack is different (ie Eldo-type) then the one they practiced placing pro in and they place nothing that will stay put or hold a big fall. I guess it is easier to make enough money to buy a rack then to learn how to use any of it safely. eek. Somehow it makes me feel better and more relaxed to watch people on the NW Corner, Hair City, Outer Space, even Jules Verne. At least they know what they are doing. CB




        By  Anonymous CowardJul 11, 2002


        I must have screwed up.  There was an early move on that first pitch that felt tougher than the first pitch at George's Tree in Lumpy (5.9).  The rest of it was more like 5.7, just an awesome route.




        By  Kevin CurriganFrom: LakewoodJul 20, 2002


        At the top of P3 on the left side there is a tiny, right facing dihedral.  The plate/flake perpendicular to this on the face is loose.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoAug 8, 2002


        Led the route today and felt P1 to be solid (7) with one polished hold on the crack. Maybe a half grade higher because its a little slippery. But what difference does it make, splitting hairs over a (7) climb? Definitely test your mettle on P2 and take the flake to the right (8) before the belay ledge (lay it back and smear). On the last pitch read Matt Bauman's description above and go for it.  That way is the right way, for the Bastille finale, in my opinion.




        By  Kevin CurriganFrom: LakewoodSep 12, 2002


        The variation at the top of pitch two is definitely the way to go for if you're up for it.  Its easier than Reggae only in that it is shorter.  Technically it feels about the same as it has the layback thing going at 5.8.  It protects at the bottom of the flake with a big cam; #9 Metolius.




        By  SteveSep 21, 2002


        First, this is a frickin' damn good climb.  Second, I think that there are many reasons that warrant giving this route a 5.7 c/d S (V) grade, although it can be done 5.6 C1.  The traverse to gain the crack on the first pitch is frickin' hard: the crux move requires technical stemming and finger locking and the feet have been super-greasy ever since some ignoramus decided to use some old motor oil instead of chalk to "tic" the holds.  There is also groundfall potential because you must wait till you gain the crack to place gear lest the throngs of watching climbers and gapers will think that you are a miserable coward that barely deserves to slave away at belaying a sportie at Table Mountain let alone climb THE Bastille Crack.  I'd recommend a stick clip to pre-place gear in the crack in case you get gripped up there.  After that, its pretty much a cake walk unless you get your haul bag stuck.  If this happens or another party slows you down, the ledge at P3 is a good place to bivy.  After completing the climb, a tricky 3.9 sportaneering gully with difficult route-finding must be descended in order to get back to your car.




        By  Ernie PortFrom: Boulder, ColoradoSep 27, 2002


        While passing this route on our way to the upper west side of the Bastille recently I spotted a young woman really struggling to work out the beginning of the crack.  I noticed her leader had combined P1 & P2.  I'd be curious how this situation worked out.  I suggest when leading this route, and combining 1 & 2 or any long routes close to the stream, especially with inexperienced climbers, bring 2-way radios.  Otherwise, you'll be sitting up on that ledge waiting and waiting, unable to hear or see your partner, until finally forced into an assumption which can lead to an accident. Be careful out there!




        By  Anonymous CowardSep 27, 2002


        Hey Ernie, I was on the crack today with my girlfriend and I strung P1 and P2 together. As far as the climbing when it was nice not to have to stop. There was some confusion with the who was on belay etc. As soon as she got up to me, we figured out a system of tugs etc so there wouldn't be any accidents. I have never climbed The Bastille before and I love it! I wasn't real sure how the walkie-talkies would have worked out so I left them at home...Yeah I'll know better next time....Oh yes, there will be a next time!

        Bottom felt like a greasy 5.8.  I thought it was equal to Reggae.

        According to "Best of Boulder", this route is now 5.8+!  According to "Accidents in North American Mountaineering 2002", this route is named "Bestowal Crack".  Just shows you can't believe everything you read ... and a good editor is hard to find ...

        Current speed records on the Bastille North Face are: July 1998 ground to top of climb  5 minutes 33 seconds ground to summit of crag (above YOUR MOTHER)  6 minutes 59 seconds  P.S. It will never gain in popularity, but climbing down the BASTILLE CRACK is excellent.  It's 5.7, the same as an ascent of the route.




        By  Bruce BerkowitzJul 18, 2003


        Great climb.I dunno, maybe I lucked onto the right sequence, but i thought the first pitch was not the crux. I agree with those that though that the 3rd pitch was the hardest. More committing, at any rate.  Still a classic any way you slice it.




        By  TBDJul 21, 2003


        Instead of the normal 5.4 chimney section of the last pitch (about 1/2 way, after gaining the huge sloping ledge), consider the next giant dihedral to right.  It offers an offwidth and some crack/face climbing.  It goes at 5.7 and is more consistent with the grade for the previous 3 pitches.  Also, more fun in my opinion.

        This climb is great.  Easily the best 5.7 around.  As for the rating, it compares nicely to The Owl (Dome), Empor (Cob Rock), and Verschnidung (West Ridge), all 5.7 crack climbs.




        By  Rich AschertFeb 1, 2004


        Just FYI, the 1967 guide rates the Bastille 5.6, Calypso 5.5, Tagger 5.8, Vertigo 5.10, Ruper 5.7, Grand Giraffe 5.8, T2 5.9 etc.etc. I guess 5.6 isn't what it used to be.




        By  George BellFrom: Boulder, COFeb 3, 2004$(function(){$('#stars_779380471').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        If this climb were rated solely for "maximum ego improvement" it would be 5.12 by now!  Sometimes the difficulty of a climb CAN change over time.  Holds may break off, or become slick with repeated use.  I'm not sure if this has occurred on this particular climb (I didn't climb it in the 60s or 70s) but it's something to consider.  I don't believe the individual rating of a climb is important except as compared to other climbs.




        By  Tony BFrom: Around Boulder, COFeb 3, 2004 rating:  5.7 5a 15 V+ 13 MVS 4b$(function(){$('#stars_573990785').html(starsHtml(3, 'avg'));});


        The climb has gotten harder, at least since I moved here in 1995- slicker, more polished, etc.  So I don't know how it was in 1960 or whatever, but I guess I expect some upgrading. For what it's worth, I'd give it 5.7 right now. As I recall, the rating was boosted to keep tentative leaders at the 'real 5.7 grade' away because they kept falling off of the start, which was not protected well by most 5.7 leaders cruxing there. Other climbs, such as Grand Giraffe have seen similar action. I've done it maybe 4X, once every few years since 1995 and each time it seems slicker than the last.  Once it starts getting slick, people start slipping more, and the slippery slope of schmarm speeds along. Grand Giraffe is harder than it was.  10a is fair.  Plus, 10a is usually easier than 9+ anyway. As for T2, you all know that the starting flake fell off right?  That the past crux hold does not exist, and that the ground below has eroded?  Now I'm not an old guy, and I 'never was' so calling me 'washed-up' or a 'has been' is quite a stretch. SO I guess I'll be considered objective here?  Nah- I'll get labeled something or another by whoever, according the their agenda. So here's my take on it. I agree that in many cases the grades got softer. Some of this because certain climbs got much easier with the advent of sticky rubber, and others because of gear/protection options. Maybe when the average 5.9 got easier, but a good solid crack climb, (were rubber and pro are not relevant did not change), the grade on that moved by comparison and got 'harder.'  Maybe only 20% of all routes really changed, so the system moved to upgrade 20% not downgrade 80%? Maybe that's why I can climb hard cracks but thin face hurts me?  As for grades on other routes, particularly 'modern' or 'new wave' free climbing grades. I suspect there is some element of ego from previous sandbaggers and current mercy-graders.  I'm certainly not feeling any stronger than 10 years ago, but seem to climb more hard routes despite somewhat frail health.  So what can I say?  The times change and I'm still having fun.  That sums it up.

        Climbed the Bastille Crack for the first time yesterday afternoon.  I've climbed at Eldorado for several years now and have finally gotten the chance to climb Bastille Crack (there is always a line at the base of it).   Polished, dirty, lots of lost gear, pigeon crap, and usually a line of people on it. The canyon is much too big to wait for this route to open up.

        Climbed it this weekend and got to lead the whole thing b/c my partner had already led it a few times.  I think it's a stellar climb.  I'm a 5.7/5.8 leader and found it challenging.  Tricky moves throughout.  Started at about 9 am.  Nobody waiting at the bottom, and pretty much had the climb to ourselves.  The infamous slippery P1 wasn't slippery, and the pro was just fine.  Still probably a good idea to be very cautious at the bottom of the P1 crack b/c a fall from there could be bad.  Really bad if your pro pulls.  I didn't find a slippery section on the whole climb.  I think because the rock was still cool (no sweaty hands) and the route hadn't had any traffic yet that day.  Tried the 5.8 variation at the top of P2 but didn't quite get it.  Couldn't turn the corner from the lower traverse to the right-facing side of the flake.  Seemed like the only way to do it was to pull a big lieback, but I was too pumped by the time I tried that, and ended up falling and heading up the standard route.  Can anybody offer some beta on this move?  Cool route everyone.  A must do.

        I climbed the Bastille with my 5 year old son last week and it was great. When climbing with little kids (if anyone other than me does?) the hard part is actually the 5.4 part of the climb because of the reach. I had to push his bum up a couple of the rocks meanwhile I could not keep up to him on P2.  Fun climb but a crack climb. Kids might do better on the Werk Supp route, I will let you know later this week!

        THE classic. The queues don't form for the access reason alone. Consider that many only do P1 but this designation is for the entire route. On the rating, the old 5.6 was before a general consensus. The 5.8 rating (Rossiter, 1989) was before it became ultra-polished. It was down-graded to .7 but after a many-year hiatus I am astonished at how polished a route can become and believe a return to .8 is justified for the hardest move on P1 with the variation on P2 being 8-. Expect more Eldo routes to show similar signs of wear.




        By  Anonymous CowardJun 12, 2004


        The Ernie Port photo shows the step across from the flake to the crack on P1 for those curious about the part that became greasier after the 80s. Newer leaders, be sure you slot this crack before committing but don't immediately slot a backup higher above you, IMO - you might need the room and the crux goes rather quickly; this has been the scene of far too many accidents.

        Let's remember that at one point in time, there was no such thing as a 5.11.  This used to be a .6 out of a possible .10.  It now gets a 5.7 rating because we all love Eldorado and it's own personal stiff rating system.  Sure I'll lead .11d at sport park.  But I'm still shut down above .10a at Eldo.  That's just the way the cookie crumbles.   We are using the "Yosemite decimal system".  Try leading the first pitch of "After Six" in Yosemite Valley.  This pitch used to be considered 5.6, and it now gets the 5.7 rating.  This Pitch is also WAY harder and more sustained than anything on Bastile.  Make sure to use an extra long sling at the starting flake,  I had a cam walk all the way up and out of my ownership.Having at least three 1"+/- pieces extra at the main ledge before p4 makes the anchor simpler.  There are several bomber placements in this range at this belay.  A 50m rope will get you to the top from here if you watch the rope drag(long slings).All things aside, I love this route.  A great way to shake off the cobwebs after winter.

        Robert Curtis - I did this last thursday after climbing the first pitch of Touch and Go (8+), honestly I think between a hard 5.7 to a solid 5.8 is fair (for the first pitch).  Lots of fun!

        I climbed the Bastille Crack again last weekend with my buddy Rob, who taught me to climb 22 years ago. We were the second party on Saturday morning. The first party was from Illinois, and they were great guys enjoying a week in the Rockies. At the bottom of the third pitch, the belayer offered to wait and let us pass on the fourth pitch, because we were climbing a bit faster than them. We took him up on the offer, I gave them a little beta on avoiding rope drag on the last pitch, and climbed quickly. A beautiful day, a classic climb, friendly climbers. Wouldn't it be great if we could all treat each other like these guys treated us?




        By  Michael KullmanAug 12, 2004


        I think the crux on the first pitch might be 8ish if you are short, definitely 7ish if you are taller (like me).

        Did this one last Saturday.  I'd say P1 goes at 5.8 due to the glassy like finish on the rock.  Also, I recommend the 5.8 variation on the last pitch.  I'm guessing a red Alien would have fit nicely at the crux (last move of the climb), which of course I didn't have because it disconnected from me somehow while I was fiddling with gear.  Thus, Larry's red Alien took a ground fall.  RIP red Alien, you were badly missed :( .  The green Alien I used was just barely cammed.  At the crux, just remember you have good feet, just keep moving them up!

        Hi guys, I'm sure I'm not as good a climber as most of you are, but I just redid the Bastille Crack a day before Bastille day, and I couldn't disagree more with your comments.  I first did it in June of 1975, and have done it a few times since.  It still seemed no harder than a 5.6 to me, maybe minimal 5.7.  The first pitch isn't any greasier than I remember it .  I'm sorry, I just don't get it.  It is a great climb, but it's not that hard.

        I did this 1st time last week; I would simply second most of the comments here. It wasn't difficult, I thought the 1st pitch was EZ, everyone says it is the crux. 2nd and 3rd pitches tripped me up a little. AWESOME climb! What is this talk of greasy 1st pitch? I had no problem and I don't even use chalk.  colorado-hiking.net/bastille1....

        Lots of gear on 4th pitch!  My partner and I got into a jam last night when we ran out of light and had foolishly left our headlamps at home.  Because of this, our cleaning of the 4th pitch was hurried and whoever is the first to climb it today (Saturday, October 8th) will find some decent pieces.  Of that person wishes to trade those piece for some tasty beer and good karma, please call Ryan @ 303.746.5643 and I will happily pick them up.  Also, the days are getting shorter so don't forget your headlamps, even if you leave the house in the early afternoon, by the time you wait for a couple of parties and get going, it gets dark fast.  Thanks again to the guys who were kind enough to lower us a headlamp from the top (we had made it to within 50 feet of the summit when I decided not to break an ankle trying to lead out in pitch darkness).  Thanks!  Oh yeah, great route of course, I thought the crux was the 3rd pitch and that is is 5.7, but it's old school Eldo 5.7 for sure.




        By  Anonymous CowardNov 1, 2005


        There is no way the first pitch is 5.8. I would rate it at a 5.7-, but it was pretty wet when I climbed it. I can see how if you climb it wrong it could be harder. It is a step from a big stance at the bottom of the flake, to good feet and nice holds.  Pitch 3 is the crux and went at easy 5.7, it is really short with big holds all over and really good gear whenever you want.   I took 1 set of cams to #2 Camalot w/ doubles in green, yellow and red Aliens, and about 5 stoppers. I  wish I would have had a lot of big stoppers, some hexs and 1 set of cams from green Alien to #1 Camalot. It would be fun to climb this with just nuts and hexs and I'm definitely going to do that next time.  A fun route and a must do, I can see why it gets so much traffic.




        By  Jeff JohnsonFrom: Folsom, CAJun 7, 2006


        This crack is probably by far one of the most exciting and thrilling in all of Eldorado Canyon.  5.7+ is a good rating, a standard rack with plenty of cams will do you just fine.  The first ten feet or so of the second pitch has a small roof and can be somewhat tricky if you don't have much experience with roofs.  But overall very good climb and worth climbing.

        After never wanting to wait in line, I decided to send this route on Sat. morning.  Got to the base about 6:45 and no one was on the Bastille, yet.  Found the route to not nearly as slick as I thought it would be and 5.7 a very fair rating.  I think most of the route is 5.6 with a couple 5.7 moves on P1 and P3.  Pro placement is not trivial on the first pitch, but it's all there, if you seek it out.  Classic, one not to be missed.

        The third pitch is perhaps the best 5.7 pitch I've done anywhere.  Simply amazing movement, location, and protection.  Also, the 4th pitch is very easy to get confused on the proper route.  Check the topo before you leave the ground.

        Led the first pitch again yesterday after doing a number of 8's recently  in Eldo and at JTree, and no way is the first pitch 5.8 - at least not for a 6' male with a -1/2" ape index.  5.7 definitely feels right - but your crack technique and gear placing skills must be solid.  I'm also not sure why folks get confused about the 4th pitch.  To me, there's only one place to climb that looks anything like the published grade of the pitch (5.6).  Everything else anywhere nearby looks MUCH harder.  OTOH, I find the description above of this pitch to be confusing and not matching the pitch well.  Just move slightly down-ramp from the belay and climb up in the easiest spot and follow the easiest climbing.  It's really pretty obvious (of course, maybe I'm just not a good enough climber and so am not tempted by the other possibilities! ;^)

        Did this guy today, it took 4 hours though because we started at 2! and it rained for a good hour, so we had to wait a little. My first time though on the thing, it was incredible! sustained and classic. The rain gave Ryan and I a whipping though. But what a great climb.




        By  Alex BurtonFrom: Colorado Springs, COAug 19, 2007


        Finally, found the time to get out and do this one.  My wife and I were in boulder for our 10th wedding anniversary, so her gift to me was following me on the Bastille.  What an incredible climb. Pitch #3 was definitely my favorite, with great position and gear.  I did the traditional finish up the chimney, and finished that by moving left from the top of the chimney up about 8-10 feet of slightly overhanging pocketed face.  It was a fun, bouldery, but very short add on, that reminded me of Hueco Tanks.

        No wonder this route always has a line, THE BEST 5.7 EVER!  Can easily be done in 2 longer pitches without much rope drag if you have fairly good rope management skills.  Climb past the first pitch and then past the start of Out Space then up to the Traverse at the top of the in cut ramp.  Belay before doing the Traverse.  From there, lead to the top.  Have Fun!

        I'm not quite 6', I'm a much better face climber than crack climber, and I made the traverse from the flake on P1 pretty early. That said... I would rate it an 8. Maybe I did it wrong, because the crux on P3 I felt to be easier than the crux on P1. Awesome climb though.

        There is a very loose flake right below the second belay. It makes for a great left foot when heading for the belay ledge, but when I stepped on it it flexed about half an inch. I was suprised that it didn't break off. Fortunately there are plenty of other options to use and the climbing is very easy in that section. Have fun on this route and be careful. Peace.




        By  P.D.WilliamsFrom: LakewoodJun 17, 2009


        Hmmm.  I was a bit disappointed. Rewritten is a way better 5.7. I last climbed the Crack back in '78 (Litz are you out there?). Amazing what cam technology can do to your adrenaline rush. By the way, does anyone in Boulder have a job? By 9:30 on a Tuesday morning, Eldo is teeming with people top roping on the Bastille.  What the hey?

        Could someone tell me about the 5.8 variation on P2. Is it the OW that traverses roughly 25ft beneath the next belay? I think I may have gotten off route a little because this seemed to be closer to a 5.8. If so does the actual route turn to face climbing during this section? thanks

        Nervous going into it.  But when I got to the chains on the first pitch, I knew the whole route would be pure fun. Don't get spooked by 'polished rock'.  Great climbing, and check out the cable that Ivy Baldwin used to tightrope over to the Wind Tower.  If you liked this route, try the Lover's Leap Crack off 470 and 85. It's got the same exposure and a 'two move stem crux'.




        By  S.cort CortopassiFrom: Boulder, CONov 2, 2009


        CAREFUL! As you come over the bulge before the awkward traverse on the 2nd or 3rd pitch (don't know which because we did the route in 3 pitches), there is a VERY loose, unmarked flake. It scared the hell out of me and I would have marked it, but A, it was dark; B, I had no light; C, or markers. Will someone please mark it?

        I climbed the first pitch of this last September.  My second lead at 5.7, and yeah, the step below the crack is slippery, but if you reach into the crack, there's a tiny ledge of rock inside the crack on the side that you're stepping from that you can wrap your fingertips around and get a pretty solid grip (or was I dreaming).  I had to feel around in the crack for a bit to find it.  It was a lot of fun, and just the first pitch deserves classic status for being as vertical as it is at the grade, and the rock is beautiful.  Clouds rolled in and it was raining as we rapped down from the first belay.    Re: the grade...I don't know what all the fuss is about.  I don't see people trying to upgrade Friday's Folly, which I led the day before, and found much more difficult, at least in the problem-solving and psychological aspects of it.  For one, the moves on the first pitch of the Bastille Crack were obvious, no guessing, and if you have trouble placing adequate gear here (how?!) you should work your way up to the grade more slowly.  It was easy to protect, even for a beginner like me.  Having to watch out for cars while you belay is a little odd....




        By  flynnJan 11, 2010


        Re the fourth pitch: when in doubt, go up and left. When you can't see around a corner, reach, and your hand will land on a 5.6 hold. If it looks harder than 5.6, don't go there. If it feels harder than 5.6, you're off route. Remember up and left.




        By  Gary SchmidtFrom: Boulder, COFeb 1, 2010


        Yes, and per Chris' comment above about belaying the road, I actually threw my rope down on the road while rappelling down off of Werk Supp and a car came and drove right over it! Didn't even bother to try and go around.

        Did this climb today for the first time, and it was great.  I did the 8 variation on the 2nd pitch and didn't have any big cams but was able to slot a nut up and left from the start of the short traverse.  The variation was not to difficult, but it did feel a little run out.    It had rained last night, but the route looked dry. The 4th pitch felt like 5.8s though as half the holds had water on them and couldn't be used, be careful if it's wet.

        A friend and I did Bastille Crack a few weeks ago.  I have a question about the final pitch variations.  I the new (awesome) Eldo Guide book it lists an 8- PG variation that climbs the corner off-width and it lists an 8+ PG-13 variation that takes the nice crack just to the left of the off-width.  We did the "8- PG" variation which approximately matches the "fun finish" listed above, and found the gear by the crux to be a little lacking.  Maybe a #5 would protect the last few moves up the off-width, but with a standard rack you find yourself about 10 feet above your last piece(s) and only 16 feet above a ledge.  I haven't done the crack to the left, but I have a hard time imagining how the gear could be worse given that it's a finger/hand crack.  Any thoughts?

        Unbelievably sweet line!  No issue with the polish - the constrictions of the crack hold your fingers and hands just fine.  Loved the 5.8 finish variation.

        This was one of my first leads and a great climb.  And the low crux getting into the hand crack I was told to protect before commiting to the hand crack.  Which is done easily and you don't have to worry about your gear ripping out of that sketchy flake.

        Call me silly, but I found P2 to be a good deal harder than P1. P1 was scarier until you've protected after the step-across, but otherwise, I wonder how P2 gets a lower rating? Superb climb and excellent for every foot of it to the top of the last pitch!  In addition too, linking P1 & P2, with 70m doubles we easily linked P3 & P4. It could possibly work with a 60m single if you are smart with your pro placements on the first part of P4 and don't mind running that part out.  BTW, my 5.8 rating is just in relation to how the climb felt to me compared to ratings in Yosemite Valley. Eldo's ratings are stout :-)

        There did not seem to be any moves that warrant 5.7. I submitted a 5.4 rating because it seemed easier than any other 5.5-6 multi-pitch routes I have done. The short third pitch was definitely the funnest climbing of the entire route.

        Pitch 4 did have that funky stance on it, but I don't think it's 5.7. I have sweated bullets on 5.6 pitches in the Gunks, and this route was CHILL. If this is 5.8, then I should be one-hanging Jumbo Love.

        Tyler, the first three pitches are way harder than 5.4. If you think The Wind Ridge (5.5) is harder than the Bastille, you are crazy. Calling this climb 5.4 goes well beyond sandbagging, it's being a jerk.

        The transfer at the first crack can easily be protected with a 0.5 if you can reach across to the crack.  I placed this before I fully committed and was way fine.    Overall, fun route, I'd give it 5.7. Did it this morning at 8 and while cold, we had the whole wall to ourselves (no wonder....no sun haha).  Glad I woke up to do this.

        After many years of not doing this route and just walking by... Plan B ended up with us on this route while rock trumbling was going on at Redgarden!  Personally found it to be anti-climactic!  Pitch 2 was great! Combining 1 & 2 would be a great pitch and maybe 1, 2, and 3 with a 70m would be stellar! 4 and 5 were just not interesting, blocky, and slightly wandering ... feel these 2 pitches take away from it being classic!  Atop pitch 3 is a fixed cam a #1 & 2 maybe a 3 cam should help that belay also a stopper, too. Atop pitch 2 with a pin gear about 1 to 2 inches... I used a lrg stopper and tricam.... Extend those runners to not sacrifice your cams... so many cams walked deep into the flake systems.... Leave the small stuff behind... and the big stuff, too, 1/2" to 3" place non stop, so double up on those if you like placing pro very 8-10 ft. and personally think of this climb as G rated!  Superfun, though don't get me wrong... will do again for sure... enjoyed the historic pin scars, and blown & cracked pins on this route... good reminder to back them up or just skip and place pro!

        Does anyone know what the grade is for doing the more direct line for pitch 4 (according to the pitch breakdown in the description).  I didn't traverse all the way over to the handcrack/gully and instead took the first line up that I could (shallow, corner-type thing that turned into face climbing past some shrubberies).  The grade felt in line with the previous pitches, and besides being a little dirty/loose, it was fun.

        Climbed this route again yesterday for the 5th or 6th time and finished right before a wicked storm rolled in. Had what I would guess to be 70+ mph winds for the hike down. Super fun! Has anyone done it in 2 pitches with a 70m? I was thinking you could link pitches 1-3 (the best climbing), and 4/5 with some long slings for the traverse on pitch 4.   It's also quite easy to link 3/4 with a 60m, I thought about attempting pitches 3-5 yesterday, but we had a 60m rope and I think I would have came up about 20' short and had some bad rope drag.

        Did it in 2 pitches yesterday morning with a 60m.  Single rack to 4.  If this is your first trad or trying to break into 5.7/5.8, the crack will SEW up with doubles from fingers to 4.  No needs for nuts.  0.3 protects off the deck very nicely.  If you're comfortable running it out, 2 pitches is the way to go.

When you're 30 feet off the deck and you realize that you committed yourself to this free climb, you're focused like a fiend. Didn't want to start "The Elvis" and peel off. Much relief at the summit by the old cables with the orange sunset. A memory etched in my mind forever. Felt a rush of adrenaline in my veins after that climb that got me hooked on climbing for life.

        I recovered a cam 9-13-2014 that someone probably abandoned as fixed. PM me with brand/size/etc. and I'll get it back to you.

        Doesn't get any better for a classic climb (unless you are moonlighting on a birthday climb with your best friends in tandem, and then it's simply CLASSIC).

        Pitch 4/5 can be a bit confusing if you don't check out topo a ahead of time, mistakenly got off route and had to back track to get back onto route. Accidentally left a yellow Neutrino in a piton on pitch 5! There for the taking!

        Climbed Bastille Crack and Rewritten the weekend of 8/15/15. In our humble opinion, Rewritten is a grade harder than Bastille Crack. So 5.6/5.7 or 5.7/5.8, take your pick. Personally have Bastille Crack at 5.7 and Rewritten at 5.8.   Most of this route is protected from the sun which is nice. P1 is pretty polished. P1 & P2 are the crux pitches goes easy after that. The downclimb from the summit is pretty cool.  Bastille Crack and Rewritten are awesome climbs!

          	  	              	      	  	    1st pitch of The Bastille Crack.   	  Absolutely great climb today, the first pitch is a bit polished but otherwise really great. Had to abandon a #11 BD stopper on pitch 3 or 4, so if anyone gets it out, please let me know.  Also, the attached picture is of the group that was ahead of us, if you'd like the rest of the photos, just message me your email.

        My follower had to leave my beloved 0.5 x4 on the 4th pitch. If anyone gets it out, I can provide 12 tasty beers in exchange.

        Accidentally left a tied sling on the barrier wall opposite the Bastille Crack today. Blue with a black covering the neck.  If someone picked it up, please contact me...it isn't very valuable but has sentimental value...it was given to me by a dear friend.  Thanks.

        Super fun route. The last time I climbed it around 15 years ago I didn't enjoy it as much as I could have, since it started pouring rain on the 4th pitch, and we topped out with lightning snapping all around. A much more pleasant day today.

        Anybody have the backstory on the exploded pin on P4? As I wandered by it, I got lost in a daydream of someone blowing it out as they whipped by holding a loose block, although I suspect something more mundane, like someone trying to remove it via funkness. It would make for a nasty landing if that was your first and only pro and you fell.

        I thought 5.7 was fair, although I'm from the Midwest, so I'm used to stiff grades. The first pitch was amazing but not nearly as difficult to climb or protect as people are making it seem. A #4 helps a lot for psychological purposes, because you can shove it in that huge flake right before doing the crux traverse, although you do have to play with it to get a solid placement since the crack is a bit flaring. I actually found the short 3rd pitch to be the crux of the climb. Exiting that overhanging finger crack by pulling over the small roof was quite spicy on lead, as there were next to no feet and I ended up having to lock off a crimp to get my feet up and pray there was something better above (luckily, there was a thank-God jug!). Knowing how to crack climb definitely helps (esp. for 2nd pitch), and if you don't, I could see where people would find the route sandbagged, but if you do, it's an incredibly fun climb.

        Had to bail off Bastille due to weather a week ago and left a #0.75 Black Diamond with a green biner on it halfway up the first pitch. If you happened grab this and want to return it, give me a call 3306963878.

        Climbed for the first time today. Found it to be much harder than Rewritten. Take as many #3s as your heart desires for sewing up the 2nd pitch.

        BC = rad. Fun times. Look out for the #1 Camalot graveyard 1/4 of the way up P2. I think there are about 5 in there.... Extend yer pro, buddy!

        The Bastille Crack is, in many climbers opinion, one of the best moderate multi+pitch routes in North America. If you have strong lead+climbing skills at the 5.8 level, a competent, experienced partner, and the weather is nay cold, you should have a blast. (If either of you flail on the first 1/2 pitch .. heed the Gods and rappel at the chains, otherwise all kinds of negative are likely to manifest.) Enjoy the crack climbing by making the moves slowly, with the joy of physical movement. Be courteous and graceful at the base, and en route, as the desire to climb this route can result in amped up emotions amongst fellow humanoid rock climbers.... Pay homage to our passionate & ballsy & talented patriarch, tight+wire walker (sans leash) Ivy Baldwin at the top by clipping the 1" steel anchor cables. Then perhaps head up to the Visitors Center, and watch the DVD of the history of the Canyon with footage of Mr. Ivy Baldwin's high wire walks  (and then hit the pool (now heated, summer 2016,) for a grrreat way to soak it all in). Enjoy.

        This was my first rope solo back in 1975, and after decades away, my wife and I made a quick overnight trip in and out of town last year so I could do a fortieth anniversary rope solo of it.  Unfortunately, however, we were so tired we ended up oversleeping in the hotel that morning and found the usual conga line on the route and in line when we got there. I was pretty bummed, because I only had a few hours available for the climb and it clearly wasn't going to be happening from the end of the line at the rate things were moving. Then all of a sudden, and seemingly out of nowhere, dark clouds and a truly fierce wind came up along with some rain, so everyone in line scattered and the first two parties on the route bailed. Once everyone dispersed, I was able to jump on it and was lucky the wind edged back a bit and the rain became intermittent. All in all, it all made for a fairly wild and somewhat less-than-casual go of it, and I felt incredibly lucky to have been able to do it again.  But the most striking thing about the whole experience wasn't so much the climb but rather that so little had changed in Eldo and on the route itself since 1975. It was like being whisked back through the decades in a time machine - I still can't get over how odd that aspect of it felt. On top of that every other move and placement was like running into a long lost friend with all kinds of memories flooding back. It was also a treat to be able to lay a hand on Ivy Baldwin's cable at the top.  Say what you will, but it's as timeless a classic as they come.

        I got a RED #1 BD CAM STUCK at the top of the second pitch. If you find it and have an iron grip to pull the thing out, you will be rewarded with beer and good karma....  Cheers, Ryan call/text me at 303-653-6260

        P4 variation - what is it? Went straight up from the belay instead of traversing left. Still crossed the traversing gap but then set up the belay by the pin and headed straight up through some easy roof moves (harder than 5.6 though). This seem to be the harder variation described but haven't found any info on a name or thoughts on the rating. Just curious.  P4. 5.6, 100'. Traverse left to a short corner with a destroyed fixed pin. Continue traversing left on awkward, off-balance moves past another fixed pin (crux). Go all the way left to a hand crack, and climb it to a corner. ****Don't start up too soon or you'll be off route on a harder variation.**** Climb the corner, then continue up and right on easy ramps to a belay stance below or just right of a chimney.

        Bailed at the top of P3 yesterday (11/6/16) (partner was panicking and we had run out of daylight), I had to leave a #0.75 Cam, a green DMM biner, and a locking biner at a piton lower down. If anyone recovers them, it would be great if you could reach out to me to return them.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This exciting pitch is an alternative to the 5.9+ P4 of X-M and is actually more in character with the "sporty" P3 of X-M. It's even protected by similar sketchball, rusty, Eldo pins, but at least there are 3 instead of only 2....  From the belay atop X-M's P3, look at the first dihedral to the right of Outer Space's P1. This is Liquor Mart. X-M continues along the broken strata up and right, while Liquor Mart goes straight up the dihedral. This is characterized by compression moves, difficult clips, and a crux move left to get established in the dihedral itself. A few moves above the 3rd and final lousy pin (not including the stray one way up and right) more gear can be had; the climbing also gets significantly easier. Finish and belay on the large, sloping Outer Space ramp.  I recommend linking P3 of X-M with this rather than building a belay at the sloping shelf at the guidebook finish of X-M-P3. That way, there is even more rope out to soften your fall onto the manky pins!Location This ascends the first dihedral to the right of Outer Space's P1.Protection Single cams from 00 to #3 and long slings.

        Great route. As for the name, Chip told me after they did the FA they asked Derek what they should name it, and with out any hesitation, Derek proclaimed "Liquor Mart!" Club salute for Sheaf Stout.

        Cool route and fun movement.  Lower section definitely has some sporty moves.  Pins  at the crux (there are 3) held a fall as of April 2016. Really unique movement for Eldo.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description Saturnalia is a single pitch climb worthy of a star or two, but comes on top of 2-3 other pitches of good rock and good climbing. All-in-all, I don't know of a way to get this route without doing at least 2-star climbing.  Climb Bastille to Outer Space, or X-M to reach the big sloping ledge as for the final pitch of Outer Space. From the base of the last pitch of Outer Space, traverse up and right on the ledge perhaps an additional 10-15 feet. You will see a brown-painted bolt hanger overhead at the lip of the overhang. Build the belay for the base here.   Climb chalked up holds from the ledge upward and left to reach a few stopper placements (good #4 and #12 BD, or Eq size) which are nice, considering one loose hold immediately above them. Continue up and left to the jugs and the clip (reachy for short people) and then pull the lip of the overhang (5.10) and establish yourself on the upper wall. Climb up a slightly wandering, but obvious line of holds, passing a few placements to reach a 'diagonal/horizontal' crack (2-3.5" cams) and then up and left towards the second bolt. Clipping the second bolt can be done from the best holds if you are very tall. If you are of average height, it will be thinner holds for a strenuous clip. If you are short, it might be a little ennervating. After clipping the bolt, continue up past thinning, improbable holds to the left, directly, or to the right have all been done (3 ppl's beta, 3 different ways) but each are difficult. Establish yourself on a sloping ledge with a few juggy holds and place gear in a crack low and to the left (large stopper + .75-1" cam). From there, continue straight up on 'Lost In Space' (5.9, R 'lost with spice?') on a few questionable looking holds and not much protection, or start up and then traverse left to Outer Space (5.10-, but better protection).  This is not a good climb to do on a hot, slimy day.  Beware of loose rock!Protection The crux is protected by a bolt at your feet, but there are other considerable moves with trad gear or little gear at all protecting the fall. A rack with a single set of muts and cams 0.5"-3" is probably as good as you can do. [The] larger cams fit in a horizontal placement before the crux bolt and do add mental comfort/security to the long moves to reach the clip.

        Seconding Tony on this, I damaged a hold below the first bolt (see the first picture below).  It's loose but I couldn't totally pull it off.  If you elect to run it out to the first bolt, this hold could be a nasty surprise.  If you place the nuts shown in the picture, you will be fine.  If you think you can remove the baseball-sized loose part safely, please do.  It will not drastically affect the difficulty of the climb.




        By  HillJul 22, 2003


        Following Bryson on this route, I too encounter loose rock below the first bolt. Use extreme caution in this area, as it is very likey that any rock knocked off will land on the road below. And there is plenty of loose rock in this section. I broke off a foot hold yesterday, which scared the hell out of me, but did sail clear of people on XM.  Yikes!!  I think staying low and traversing out left after putting (or cleaning) gear in the crack will help you avoid the worst section of rock, though this may add to the difficulty.

        One star, at most.  Loose, yes.  Spice, yes.  Didn't pass mustard on public nor FHRC vote first time through.  Persistence on the part of the retro-bolter did push it through the second time.




        By  stevedMar 1, 2007


        Clipping the 1st bolt can also be done solidly from a big side-pull on the left and this is better for a shorter person. Or anyone really.  Yes, traversing lower past those 1st nuts is better - I didn't use that "loose" hold for much more than balance but if someone wants to pry it off then go for it.  Yes, I did rap down to clean what I could, and did hang slings .... from RPs. Mea Culpa.   If Charlie did lead it, then he must have used some other Very Loose Holds that were balanced up there...not to mention front-pointing on the lichen I cleaned. Lichen grows very slowly so maybe it was Lewis & Clark who did the FA....  This is a serious route, but not 'very serious'. It's not "for the masses" If you're not up for it then fine, but don't whine about it.

        Regarding the first ascent. I did not know that there was new first ascent standard in Eldorado, the "rumor has it" standard. If we start with that, we will never end. Steve, I think it is best to do your fact checking correctly and explain who, what, when, and where rather than starting a cascade of dubious revisions. Now I am concerned to think that you might be writing a guidebook to this area. The "rumor has it" guidebook is bound to be an interesting one....  Saturnalia, together with Innerspace, is one of the better pitches in the Bastille. It is a great final pitch to many of the cool three pitch link-ups that the Bastille has to offer. It provides a great alternative to the often crowded and overclimbed Outerspace. I like very much the fact that it provides a bit of pumpy climbing over the roof, as well as a techincal, thin crux higher up. If finished via Lost in Space, it is just a great pitch. As for loose rock, I don't think there is any at all, but of course that is a subjective appreciation.  I think it deserves 3 stars. rolo




        By  jack robertsApr 5, 2007


        Saturnalia is certainly a worthwhile route to finish on.  Pumpy, rough rock and a thin, balancy sequence at the end make it all the more satisfying.  But there is loose rock up there, and it isn't as good or sustained as some other climbing on other, three-star routes.  I give it two stars for quality.  Rumor has it that Charlie climbed just about everything in Eldorado Canyon. Mentioning this isn't an attempt to set a standard by which first ascents are graded.  Merely a way of keeping people honest.  Giving historical value. When it comes to trad first ascents in Eldorado, one can't always be sure that someone hasn't come before.  At the time, when the name was proposed there was a lot of speculation about who might have first climbed the rock that became the route known as Saturnalia before Michael and Steve got their fair due. It only adds interest that CF might have gone up there before anyone else.  Who knows?  Maybe Duncan soloed the thing.




        By  tooTALLtimFrom: Boulder, COJul 13, 2011 rating:  5.11b 6c 23 VIII- 23 E3 5c R$(function(){$('#stars_242466524').html(starsHtml(4, 'avg'));});


        Three stars for sure!  Pumpy, overhanging climbing to airy arete slapping and crimping; how could this not be three stars?  Seems 90% of the loose rock has been taken off by past parties.  We too found that square hold (on the traverse to the first bolt) to be loose, so we took it home.  Thanks to all who cleaned the route.  After getting to the first bolt, I took a huge sigh of relief, and was pleased to find no more long/dangerous runouts. I was also happy to be very tall while clipping the second bolt!  All and all, great climb.

Keeping climbing areas open and conserving the climbing environment

Action Committee for Eldorado



Description This route sees some traffic, but is one of the less-traveled 'popular' routes on the Bastille. The name, Wide Country, does nothing to describe the cracks in it, which are seldom larger than small-stoppers. The name more well describe the amount of territory covered in order to climb the route - lots of back and forth and rising traverses, some of which are not closely protected. The route is good, with a typical Eldo crux on the first pitch. It's thin, a little off balance, and committing, but well protected. After the crux, the route lets up enough to let you recover from your pump, or climb despite it. The second pitch is more obscure and less protectable, but can be avoided by doing the (superior) finish on X-M to Outer Space.   To climb the route: P1: Begin to the right of Bastille Crack and start up into a shallow, left-facing, 5.9 dihedral, climbing up past scant protection (if you bother with any) and after some distance getting gear and stepping right into a second, more broken corner system. At the top of these cracks, perhaps 70' up, you arrive at a decent fixed pin, and then a bolt. Clip the pin with a long runner, then the bolt with a short one, then go hard left through the crux. 2 bolts lie above this previous pin, but are of a different route. From the bolt go up and left on mild runouts through easier territory, aiming for the bottom left side of a hanging flake.  Place gear along the way on long runners if desired. On the hanging flake, you can place a 0.75" (+/-) cam or two on a long runner on its left side before launching out under it and up under it to the right, where another cam can be placed 1-1.5" before rising up under the flake (5.10b/c, S?) to a right-facing corner to reach the bolt and chain anchor. According to the Rossiter book, the climbing can be made easier but no less runout by traversing out on the face and then climbing upwards to skip the rise under the flake. The bolted belay is good; it would require 2 ropes to rap from.  P2-P3: An obscure and seldom done line traverses directly left from the belay and then climbs up a fairly indistinct line parallel to the Bastille Crack. (with a fixed pin at the first crux, and gear at the second). Then follow a left-facing corner (10b,S) left of Hairstyles and Attitudes to the top.  P2-P3: Better yet, from the bolted belay, continue on X-M to Outer Space or one of the many other possibilities.Protection A few fixed pieces along the way, particularly protecting the crux. The trad gear is RP's + stoppers + narrow cams to 2". Don't bother with doubles of anything. Take a good number of 2' runners. There are significant runouts in the 5.9-5.10- grade, but after the crux, falls would probably be clean and relatively safe.

        Also, if you do the entire route (which nobody does) you will agree that the crux of the climb is moving left from the XM belay, which involves a move harder than anything on the first pitch.  See "The Direct North Face" for a description of the "route" as it is commonly done these days.-SL

        The third pitch is a "must do" for all us sandstone junkyard junkies.

        I agree with the comment by Anonymous Coward that: "the traverse to the left off  the  XM belay is the crux of the climb" rarely is this interesting  little piece of climbing attempted. In all my years around Eldo I've never seen anyone even try it.  It's a mystifying no-hands high step onto a nubbin. I've lead this section a few times and must say that when one puts it into  the context  of Duncan Ferguson and Don Peterson in EBs on-sighting it ... it's really quite impressive. Try it and see for yourself. It's a bit of a run-out and may give you a dry throat! Kevin Worrall and I did a nice finish to this climb as well. The climbing extends the original line and maintains the standard and personality of the route. Description of the pitch is in Steve Levin's Eldorado climbing guidebook.

        This was one of the harder 11a climbs I've attempted in Eldo. The slightly awkward and fairly scary though short crux seems a bit harder than 11a to me - also, if you blow it you'll swing down and right, into the small broken dihedral that you traversed from (could hurt quite a bit). Granted, I hate to fall, so a mental edge is needed here, and for the RO that follows the crux. The RO sections of 5.9 climbing that precede the crux aren't too bad, and the climbing is really nice; though a fall shouldn't be considered a choice. I'd certainly give this climb a balzy rating. BTW, the rock is absolutely bomber.

        I did the first pitch again today.  Even more classic than I remember.  One thing concerned me, though.  There is a block that you have to pull on at the end of some run-out climbing just before the crux.  It is actually what you're standing on just before launching into the crux.  This block sounded very loose when I tapped on it.  Perhaps it has always been this way, and I've just never noticed before.  Does anyone know whether it has always been loose, or has it only become so recently?  The above comment about the rock being absolutely bomber makes me wonder.  Anywhay, be careful, but don't be deterred.  Just try not to pull out on it.

        Sick Onsight, if you are reading this page to gather beta before you climb it you are missing out on a great gut check.  Stop reading now while you still can!  Even with beta I think it's a stout lead, it seemed more scary than XM.  Bring lots of runners and balls.  Don't fall it looks like it hurts more than your ego.

        I really enjoy this climb, it's a great quick single pitch to do in the summer. I don't feel that it's particularly dangerous, all the runouts are on much easier ground and the crux is very safe (though hard!).  I found that double ropes really helped to maximize the pro on this pitch.




        By  Lisa MontgomeryFrom: Golden, COSep 10, 2014


        After the crux at the bolt, you can place a finger-sized piece or nut in a crack near the Bastille Crack attached with a double-length runner.    Save a 0.75, red Alien, and yellow Alien for the top.

        The crux is insecure but safe on a big shiny bolt, although clipping that bolt is a little spooky and reachy from a just barely secure stance. The runouts are indeed on easier terrain and probably warrant an R rating (clean but looong), but if you pulled the crux, then there's no way you're going to botch those moves.  Agree with Scott that it's a great summertime Eldo pitch early in the morning.
